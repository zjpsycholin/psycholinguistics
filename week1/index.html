‚≠ê Overview

What Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is and where it happens (formal classrooms ‚Üî informal, daily life).
The three core questions in SLA: What do learners come to know? How do they acquire it? Why do learners differ?
Key distinctions: L1 vs L2, formal vs informal learning, competence vs performance, communicative competence.
SLA as a multidisciplinary field (psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, social psychology, applied linguistics) and why integrating perspectives matters.

<h4 id="1-what-is-sla">1) What is SLA?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Acquisition of additional languages after the first (L1), in both <strong>formal</strong> (classroom) and <strong>informal</strong> (naturalistic) environments.</li>
<li><strong>Three core questions:</strong>
<ol>
<li><em>What does the learner come to know?</em></li>
<li><em>How is this knowledge acquired?</em></li>
<li><em>Why are some learners more successful than others?</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-core-concepts--definitions">2) Core concepts &amp; definitions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>L1 / native language / mother tongue:</strong> typically acquired early, without conscious effort.</li>
<li><strong>L2:</strong> any language learned after L1; often involves more conscious effort.</li>
<li><strong>Formal</strong> vs <strong>informal</strong> L2 learning: structured classroom instruction vs naturalistic exposure and use.</li>
<li><strong>Linguistic competence</strong> (underlying knowledge) vs <strong>performance</strong> (actual production).</li>
<li><strong>Communicative competence:</strong> effective use across social contexts.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-types-of-second-languages">3) Types of ‚Äúsecond languages‚Äù</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second language</strong> (locally dominant), <strong>Foreign language</strong> (limited local use), <strong>Library language</strong> (reading-focused),<br>
<strong>Auxiliary language</strong> (official/intercommunity functions), <strong>LSP</strong> (occupationally targeted, e.g., ‚ÄúEnglish for Aviation‚Äù).</li>

<li>In 2‚Äì3 sentences, <strong>classify English</strong> in your context (second/foreign/library/auxiliary/LSP) with a reason.</li>
<li>Note one <strong>learner difference</strong> you think matters most in China‚Äôs EFL settings‚Äîand why.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="during-class-activities">During class (activities)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concept sort:</strong> Match each definition to its term (competence, performance, communicative competence‚Ä¶).</li>
<li><strong>Context mapping:</strong> In groups, map examples of <strong>formal</strong> vs <strong>informal</strong> learning from your experience.</li>
<li><strong>Quick debate:</strong> ‚ÄúAptitude vs motivation‚Äîif you could improve only one for your class, which and why?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practice-micro-lab">Practice (micro-lab)</h3>
<p>Pick a small <strong>prediction</strong> about context or learner characteristics, then plan a simple check.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example prediction:</strong> Students with more <strong>informal L2 exposure</strong> report greater willingness to speak in class.</li>
<li><strong>Micro-check:</strong> 5-item anonymous poll + short speaking task; compare self-reports and participation counts.</li>
<li><strong>What would falsify it?</strong> No association or the reverse pattern.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="after-class-review">After class (review)</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Short reflection (‚âà150‚Äì200 words):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Define <strong>SLA</strong> and say whether your current learning is <strong>formal</strong> or <strong>informal</strong> (or both).</li>
<li>Name one <strong>learner difference</strong> you expect will affect your progress this semester‚Äîand how you will address it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Self-check (answer privately):</strong><br>
a) Define <strong>linguistic competence</strong> vs <strong>performance</strong>.
<!-- Competence = underlying knowledge of language; Performance = actual use/production that can include errors and hesitations. -->  
b) Give two <strong>types of second language</strong> and one teaching implication for each.
<!-- e.g., Foreign language: limited input ‚Üí design richer input tasks; LSP: occupational goals ‚Üí target domain-specific vocabulary/functions. -->  
c) What is <strong>sequential multilingualism</strong>, and why is it central in SLA?
<!-- Learning an additional language after L1 is established; most adult/late L2 learning is sequential, so SLA focuses on it. -->  
d) List two <strong>disciplines</strong> that inform SLA and what each contributes.
<!-- Psycholinguistics: mental representation/processing. Sociolinguistics/social psychology: identity, social context, interaction. -->  
e) Restate the <strong>three core questions</strong> of SLA.
<!-- What is learned? How is it learned? Why do learners differ? -->

</ol>
<h4 id="answer-key--hidden">(Answer key ‚Äî hidden)</h4>
<!--
1) SLA = the process of learning an additional language after the first; it primarily studies the phenomenon of adding languages.  
2) L1 = first/native language(s) acquired early; L2 = any language learned after L1.  
3) Informal learning = naturalistic acquisition through exposure/use without structured instruction (e.g., a child picking up English after moving).  
4) Formal learning = structured, classroom-based instruction with explicit goals (e.g., an undergraduate course in Arabic).  
5) Competence = underlying knowledge of language; Performance = actual production/comprehension in real situations.  
6) Psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, social psychology (also linguistics, education).  
7) Simultaneous = multiple languages acquired from early childhood; Sequential = additional language learned after L1 is established.  
8) Target language = the specific additional language being learned.  
9) SLA is interdisciplinary; different theories and methods yield multiple, sometimes conflicting, perspectives.  
10) What is learned? How is it learned? Why do learners differ in success?

<h3 id="ii-essay-questions">II. Essay Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>E1.</strong> Interplay of <strong>informal</strong> and <strong>formal</strong> environments: How do they contribute differently to acquisition? Can one be inherently more effective?</li>
<li><strong>E2.</strong> Significance of <strong>competence vs performance</strong>: How might discrepancies appear in learners, and what are the teaching implications?</li>
<li><strong>E3.</strong> SLA as ‚Äú<strong>adding languages</strong>‚Äù: Explore societal and personal motivations for acquiring another language.</li>
<li><strong>E4.</strong> Compare <strong>L1</strong> vs <strong>L2</strong> acquisition: What challenges/advantages arise from having an established L1?</li>
