## 📘 Overview
How do children move from isolated words to **structured vocabulary and grammar**? This week we examine **word-learning biases** (whole-object, basic-level), **mutual exclusivity (ME)/contrast**, **fast mapping**, and **syntactic bootstrapping** (using sentence frames to infer meaning). We then tackle **morphology**: productivity, **over-regularization** (the classic **U-shaped** curve), and the **Wug test**. We’ll compare **rule-based** and **probabilistic/connectionist** accounts and consider English–Mandarin differences (e.g., **count vs mass**, classifiers).

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 13, you should be able to:

- Explain **fast mapping**, **mutual exclusivity**, and **principle of contrast** and predict their effects in word learning tasks.
- Use **syntactic bootstrapping** to infer meanings for **nouns vs verbs**, including **transitivity** and **count vs mass** cues.
- Describe and graph the **U-shaped** pattern in **past-tense** and plural learning; distinguish **over-** vs **underextension**.
- Design a simple **Wug-style** test for a new inflection and justify what counts as evidence of **productivity**.
- Compare **words-and-rules** vs **probabilistic/connectionist** explanations for morphology and evaluate evidence for each.
- Identify **cross-linguistic** implications (Mandarin classifiers, verb-friendly input) for acquisition pathways.

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 9, pp. 344–360** — *Language Development* (word learning, bootstrapping, morphology).

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### ⚡ Fast Mapping & Biases
- **Fast mapping**: forming a partial, durable link between a novel word and a referent after minimal exposure.
- **Whole-object bias**: new labels tend to name **whole objects** rather than parts or properties.
- **Basic-level bias**: children prefer **basic-level** categories (dog) over superordinate (animal) or subordinate (poodle).

### 🧩 Mutual Exclusivity (ME) & Principle of Contrast
- **ME**: children assume **one label per object**; a novel word is mapped to the **unnamed** object/property.
- **Contrast**: different words signal **different meanings**; supports **fine-grained** distinctions.
- Caveat: ME can be **overridden** by context (bilingual input, part/shape/property tasks).

### 🧠 Syntactic Bootstrapping
- Children use **sentence structure** to infer meaning:
  - **Transitivity**: *“She **blicked** the ball”* (two arguments) → likely **causative** verb; *“She **blicked**”* (one argument) → likely **intransitive**.
  - **Count vs mass**: *“a **sib**”* (count noun frame) vs *“some **sib**”* (mass noun frame) → predicts **thing** vs **substance** interpretation.
  - **Noun vs verb** frames in Mandarin/English: word order, aspect markers, and classifiers provide additional **syntactic/semantic** cues.

### 🧱 Over/Underextension
- **Overextension**: applying a word too **broadly** (e.g., “dog” for all four-legged animals).
- **Underextension**: applying a word too **narrowly** (e.g., “bottle” only for a specific cup at home).

### 🧪 Morphology: Productivity & the Wug Test
- **Productivity**: applying a rule to **novel** items (e.g., *wug → wugs*).
- **Wug test** probes whether children **generalize** beyond memorized forms.

### 📉 Over-regularization & the U-Shaped Curve
- Early **correct** (memorized irregulars) → middle **over-regularization** (*goed*, *mouses*) → later **recovery** as **rules + exceptions** are consolidated.
- Reflects interaction of **memory strength**, **rule extraction**, and **competition** between patterns.

### 🧮 Accounts of Morphology
- **Words-and-rules (dual-route)**: a **rule** composes regulars; **lexicon** stores exceptions; **race** between rule and memory.
- **Probabilistic/connectionist**: a **single system** that learns graded mappings; “regularity” emerges from **distributional patterns** and **phonology**.
- Evidence to weigh: **nonce-word generalization**, **frequency effects**, **phonological neighborhood**, **error distributions**.

### 🌏 Cross-Linguistic Notes (EN ↔ ZH)
- **Mandarin**: **classifiers** in noun phrases, fewer obligatory plural markings → different path for number marking; richer **aspect** system may scaffold verb learning.
- **English**: **count/mass** morphology and articles provide early **nominal** cues; past-tense suffix **-ed** encourages **rule extraction**.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 344–360 and annotate one example each of **ME**, **fast mapping**, **syntactic bootstrapping**, and an instance of **over-regularization**.  
2. **Frames worksheet**: For five novel words, place each into **count/mass** or **transitive/intransitive** frames and write your predicted meanings.  
3. **Family data** (optional): Ask a younger sibling/cousin (or recall) one over- or underextension. Bring a one-sentence description.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 🎲 Morphological Games: The Mini-Wug (15 min)
- Groups create **3 nonce nouns** and **3 nonce verbs** with varied phonological endings (e.g., *tave, wug, spling*; *norp, chaze, glim*).  
- Class applies **plural** and **past-tense** rules; record **regularization** vs **exception-like** guesses.  
- Discuss: What counts as **evidence of productivity**?

### 2) 🔍 Bootstrapping Simulation (18 min)
- Verb frames on cards: **transitive** vs **intransitive**; clips/descriptions of ambiguous events.  
- Teams map frames → **probable meanings**; then test with **count/mass** noun frames for a new noun.  
- Debrief: Which cues were **most diagnostic**? Where did you **mislead** yourselves?

### 3) ⚡ Fast Mapping & ME Challenge (10 min)
- Show an array with one **familiar** and one **novel** object; introduce a **novel label**.  
- Predict children’s mapping under **ME**; then **override** ME by asking for a **part/property** (e.g., “Show me the **dax** that means the **handle**”).  
- Note when ME **fails** and why.

### 4) 📉 U-Shaped Curve Lab (10 min)
- Plot a **toy timeline** of irregular past-tense accuracy (e.g., *go/went*).  
- Diagnose factors that **raise** or **lower** the middle dip (input frequency, corrective feedback, phonology).

### 5) 🌏 EN–ZH Compare & Contrast (5 min)
- Quick cases: **classifiers** with numerals in Mandarin vs **plural -s** in English; implications for early **number** concepts.

### 6) Wrap (2 min)
- Write one **prediction** about when a child will **over-regularize** a new -ed verb and why.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: Choose one **verb** and one **noun** from class; explain how **frames** and **ME/contrast** guided your inference.  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: Which account (dual-route vs connectionist) better explains your **Mini-Wug** results? Why?

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 9, pp. 344–360) on ME/contrast, bootstrapping, morphology.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words)**: Design a **Wug-style** test for an **unfamiliar inflection** (e.g., a fictitious **diminutive**). Specify **items**, **procedure**, **success criteria**.  
- **Optional**: Collect **2 child utterances** (any language) that show **over-** or **underextension** or **over-regularization**; tag them with a **likely cause**.

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** What is **mutual exclusivity**, and when can it be overridden?  
<!-- ME: assume one label per object; overridden by bilingual exposure, explicit part/property requests, or strong contextual evidence. -->
<!--
**Q2.** Give a **syntactic bootstrapping** example for a **verb**.  -->
<!-- “The girl daxed the cat” (transitive) implies a two-participant/causative event; “The girl daxed” (intransitive) implies a single-participant action. -->
<!--
**Q3.** Define **over-regularization** and sketch the **U-shaped** pattern.  -->
<!-- Applying a regular rule to irregular forms (e.g., goed); early correct → mid over-regularization → later recovery as rules and exceptions stabilize. -->
<!--
**Q4.** What makes a **Wug test** good evidence of **productivity**?  -->
<!-- Generalization to truly novel forms with systematic application of the pattern across varied phonologies, not just memorized analogies. -->
<!--
**Q5.** How do **count vs mass** frames guide noun interpretation?  -->
<!-- “a N” cues count/individuated entities; “some N” cues mass/substance; in Mandarin, classifiers with numerals support individuation without plural -s. -->

## 📘 Overview

This week focuses on how children develop **morphological** and **syntactic** knowledge in the first few years of life. We will trace the emergence of **inflectional morphology**, **function words**, and **sentence structures**, and examine theories that explain how children achieve such rapid mastery, including **semantic**, **syntactic**, and **prosodic bootstrapping**.

---

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🔠 Morphological Development

- Early speech includes **single-word** utterances → **multi-word combinations**.
- Emergence of **inflectional morphemes** (e.g., -ed, -s) around age 2.
- **Overregularization errors** show internalization of rules:
  > “goed,” “foots,” “breaked”

- These errors are U-shaped:
  - Stage 1: Memorized forms (“went”)
  - Stage 2: Rule-based overgeneralization (“goed”)
  - Stage 3: Correct rule-plus-exception (“went” again)

---

### 📦 Syntactic Development

- Early utterances are **telegraphic**: “Want juice,” “Daddy go work”
- Gradual inclusion of:
  - **Function words** (e.g., determiners, auxiliaries)
  - **Complex structures** (e.g., questions, negation)

- Developmental sequence:
  1. Word combinations (18–24 mo.)
  2. Subject–verb–object (SVO) structure
  3. Negation and questions
  4. Relative clauses, passives (by ~4–5 years)

---

### 🚼 Bootstrapping Theories

- **Semantic bootstrapping**: Children infer syntactic roles from meaning.
- **Syntactic bootstrapping**: Use sentence structure to infer word meaning.
  > e.g., “She daxed the toy” → “dax” is likely a verb
- **Prosodic bootstrapping**: Use rhythm, intonation to detect structure.

---

### 🗣️ Input and Feedback

- Children’s grammatical development depends on:
  - **Quantity** and **quality** of caregiver input
  - **Recasts** and **expansions** (corrective feedback)
  - Exposure to **varied** and **structured** language

---

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🧠 Overregularization Sorting

- Provide examples of child errors: students classify as overregularized, correct, or irregular.

### 🛠️ Sentence Construction Task

- Students build increasingly complex sentences from word cards.
- Reflect on when and how children acquire these structures.

### 🔄 Bootstrapping Debate

- Divide class into groups: semantic vs. syntactic vs. prosodic bootstrapping.
- Each team defends their theory with examples and evidence.
