<!--

## 📘 Overview
Not all meaning is literal. We routinely comprehend **metaphors** (“Ideas are seeds”) and **idioms** (“spill the beans”) quickly and effortlessly. This week explores **how**: Do we **always** analyze literal meaning first, or can figurative meanings be accessed **directly**? When do **context**, **familiarity**, and **transparency** help? You’ll generate metaphors, match idioms to meanings, compare English idioms with Chinese 成语, and practice explaining how different theories account for your observations.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 9, you should be able to:

- Explain key theories of **metaphor** (Standard Pragmatic Model, Direct Access, Graded Salience, Structure Mapping, Conceptual Metaphor).
- Describe major **idiom processing** accounts (Lexicalized/Direct Retrieval, Configuration/Construction, Decomposability).
- Predict how **familiarity**, **transparency**, and **context** influence processing time and interpretive preference.
- Apply these ideas to analyze **English–Chinese** idiom pairs and paraphrase figurative meanings accurately.
- Relate basic **psycholinguistic evidence** (e.g., priming, predictability, N400) to the processing of nonliteral meaning.

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 7, pp. 267–285** — *Nonliteral Language Processing* (focus on metaphor & idioms).

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🧭 Two Big Questions
1) **Access Order**: Do listeners compute a **literal** meaning first and then revise (Standard Pragmatic Model), or can figurative meanings be **directly accessed** when salient/expected (Direct Access; Graded Salience)?  
2) **Representation**: Are idioms stored as **whole lexical entries** (like long words) or **constructed** compositionally using syntax/semantics when transparent?

### 🧩 Metaphor Processing — Competing Views
- **Standard Pragmatic Model (SPM)**: literal meaning is computed first; if it fails, infer figurative meaning via **Gricean** reasoning. Predicts early **literal preference** unless context strongly biases figurative reading.  
- **Direct Access View**: figurative meaning can be retrieved **without** a literal-first step when it is conventional/salient or contextually primed.  
- **Graded Salience Hypothesis (Giora)**: the **most salient** meaning (familiar, frequent, conventional) is accessed **first**—whether literal **or** figurative. Thus conventional metaphors (e.g., “grasp an idea”) can be as fast as literal uses.  
- **Structure Mapping (Gentner)**: metaphor = **analogy**; align **relational structure** from source (CONCRETE) to target (ABSTRACT), preserving **relations** more than surface features.  
- **Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson)**: systematic mappings in cognition (e.g., **TIME IS MONEY**, **ARGUMENT IS WAR**) organize many expressions, guiding interpretation and expectation.

**Processing signatures (typical findings):**  
- **Context** and **conventionality** reduce difficulty; familiar metaphors often show **fast reading** and **reduced N400** (predictability).  
- **Novel** metaphors cost more: extra integration and imagery can increase processing time.

### 🧠 Idioms — Storage, Construction, and Cues
- **Direct Retrieval / Lexicalized Idioms**: frequent, fixed idioms stored as **single entries**; when context strongly predicts the idiom, readers show **faster** processing (an “idiom superiority” effect).  
- **Configuration / Construction**: readers recognize an emerging **idiom configuration** across words; once enough cues accumulate, the figurative template is activated.  
- **Decomposability**: some idioms are **transparent** (each part contributes; *spill the beans* ≈ *reveal a secret*), others are **opaque** (*kick the bucket*). Decomposable idioms are more flexible (passivization, modification) and allow partial **semantic priming** from constituents.  
- **Familiarity & Transparency**: high **familiarity** speeds access; **transparency** supports partial compositionality and robustness across syntactic variations.  
- **Literal Plausibility**: when a literal reading remains plausible and context is weak, comprehenders may experience competition/slowdowns until context settles meaning.

### 🔬 Evidence Snapshots (beginner-friendly)
- **Priming/Predictability**: Strongly biasing contexts lead to **earlier** access of figurative meanings and faster completions.  
- **ERP (N400)**: predictable idioms/metaphors often show **smaller N400** at key words; anomalous or novel figurative uses show **larger N400** (greater integration cost).  
- **Eye-tracking**: shorter first-pass times on idiomatic regions when idiom completion is **expected**; longer regressions for **novel/opaque** metaphors.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 267–285 and mark **two metaphors** (one conventional, one novel) and **two idioms** (one transparent, one opaque).  
2. **Context Builder**: Write **two short contexts** that make *spill the beans* either (a) highly predictable or (b) very unlikely.  
3. **Cross-lingual List**: Bring **3 English idioms** and **3 Chinese 成语/惯用语** that you like; note **familiarity** and **transparency** (1–5 scale).

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** What does the **Graded Salience Hypothesis** predict about conventional metaphors?  
<!-- The most salient meaning—often the conventional figurative one—will be accessed first, so familiar metaphors can be processed as quickly as literal language. -->

<!--
**Q2.** Give one prediction that distinguishes **SPM** from **Direct Access** in early processing.  -->
<!-- SPM predicts an initial literal preference unless context forces figurative; Direct Access allows immediate figurative access when figurative meaning is highly familiar/salient. -->
<!--
**Q3.** What is **idiom decomposability**, and why does it matter?  -->
<!-- Decomposability reflects how much constituents contribute to figurative meaning; decomposable idioms are more flexible and can show constituent-based priming and easier syntactic variation. -->
<!--
**Q4.** How do **familiarity** and **transparency** typically affect idiom processing? --> 
<!-- Higher familiarity speeds access; greater transparency supports partial compositional processing and robust comprehension across contexts. -->
<!--
**Q5.** What ERP pattern is often observed for **predictable idiomatic completions**?  -->
<!-- Reduced N400 relative to unpredictable or anomalous completions, reflecting easier semantic integration. -->

## 📘 Overview

This week introduces one of the most fundamental processes in discourse comprehension: resolving **reference**. Whether it's identifying who “she” refers to or which object “that” indicates, listeners and readers must rapidly and accurately map **anaphoric expressions** to the correct **referents**. We'll examine **linguistic cues**, **working memory**, and theoretical models like **Binding Theory**, **Centering Theory**, and the **Informational Load Hypothesis**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is Reference?

- **Referents** are entities introduced or assumed in discourse.
- **Anaphora** refers to expressions (e.g., pronouns) that depend on a previously introduced referent.

---

### Characteristics That Aid Co-Reference

#### Of Referents:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Recency** | Recently mentioned referents are more accessible. |
| **Grammatical role** | Subjects are more likely referents. |
| **First mention** | Entities introduced early in a sentence are favored. |
| **Discourse focus** | Salient or topical entities are more accessible:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

#### Of Anaphors:

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Definiteness** | “The man” vs. “a man” guides expectations. |
| **Syntactic position** | Embedded vs. main-clause anaphors vary in processing ease. |
| **Ambiguity** | Ambiguous pronouns (e.g., “he” in male-dense contexts) increase difficulty:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Linguistic Theories of Reference

#### Binding Theory

- A syntactic theory from generative grammar:
  - **Principle A**: Reflexives must refer to a subject in the same clause.
  - **Principle B**: Pronouns cannot refer to a subject in the same clause.
  - **Principle C**: Names cannot be coreferential with a pronoun that precedes them.

#### Psycholinguistic Models

| Model | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Memory Focus Model** | Refers to the accessibility of referents held in working memory. |
| **Centering Theory** | Suggests that discourse coherence is maintained by linking current utterances to salient prior “centers.” |
| **Informational Load Hypothesis** | Proposes that pronoun interpretation is easiest when memory demands are low and discourse is simple:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 📚 Reading

- Traxler (2012), Chapter 6: *Reference* (pp. 241–260)

---

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Reference** | The act of pointing to or identifying an entity in discourse |
| **Anaphor** | A word (like “she” or “it”) that refers back to a previously mentioned item |
| **Co-reference** | The relationship between a referring expression and its antecedent |
| **Binding Theory** | A theory of syntactic constraints on reference |
| **Centering Theory** | A discourse model that explains focus and referent selection based on coherence |
| **Informational Load Hypothesis** | A theory explaining pronoun processing difficulty based on memory and sentence complexity |

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🔍 Pronoun Puzzle Game

- Show short sentences with multiple characters (e.g., “John hugged Mike. He smiled.”)
- Students must infer who “he” refers to and explain their reasoning.

### 📖 Binding Theory Test

- Provide sentence pairs and ask whether the reference is acceptable:
  - “Mary saw herself in the mirror.” ✅
  - “Herself saw Mary in the mirror.” ❌
- Discuss each Binding Principle with examples.

### 🧠 Co-reference Matching Task

- Present mini-stories with pronouns and noun phrases.
- Students draw arrows or diagrams linking referents.

## ❓ Self-Check Questions

1. What kinds of referents are easiest to recall in discourse?
2. What factors influence how we interpret ambiguous pronouns?
3. What are the three principles of Binding Theory?
4. How does Centering Theory explain discourse coherence?
5. How does sentence complexity affect anaphora resolution?
