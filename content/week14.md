<!--
## 📘 Overview
Bilinguals are **not two monolinguals** in one brain. During reading and listening, evidence shows **both languages are active at once**. This yields **cognate facilitation** (e.g., *piano* EN–IT) and **interlingual homograph/false-friend interference** (e.g., Dutch *room* = “cream”, not English *room*). We’ll build an intuition for **nonselective lexical access**, examine the **BIA+ model** (an integrated lexicon with language cues and top-down control), and discuss classic debates like **concept mediation vs word association** in translation. You’ll run mini-demos (Stroop; cognate decision) and sketch how **task demands, script, and proficiency** shape activation.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 14, you should be able to:

- Explain **nonselective lexical access** and predict **cognate** vs **false-friend** effects.
- Describe the architecture and predictions of **BIA+** (feature/letter/word layers, **language nodes**, task/decision components).
- Contrast **concept mediation** vs **word association** in bilingual translation and when each is likely to dominate.
- Discuss how **proficiency**, **age of acquisition**, **script similarity**, and **language mode** (monolingual ↔ bilingual) modulate cross-language activation.
- Interpret basic outcomes from **lexical decision**, **picture naming**, and **Stroop**-type tasks in bilinguals.

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 11, pp. 415–431** — *Bilingual Language Processing* (representation, nonselective access, cognates/false friends, BIA+; translation and conceptual mediation).

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🌊 Nonselective Lexical Access
- During word recognition, **candidates from both languages** become active if they share **form** (orthography/phonology) and/or **meaning**.
- **Cognate facilitation**: shared form + meaning → faster recognition (e.g., EN–ES *hospital*).  
- **Interlingual homographs / false friends**: same form, different meaning → **competition/interference** (e.g., EN *pie* vs ES *pie* “foot”).
- Cross-language activation occurs in **comprehension** and **production** (e.g., **picture naming** slower for bilinguals vs monolinguals due to competition).

### 🧭 BIA+ (Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus)
- **Integrated lexicon** with **feature/letter/word** layers for both languages; **language nodes** index language membership.
- Activation spreads **bottom-up** (features → letters → words) and **laterally** (competition) with **top-down** influences (task context, expectations).
- Predicts: **cognate advantage**, **false-friend cost**, and **task/context** sensitivity (e.g., language-specific cues reduce but rarely eliminate cross-language activation).

### 🔁 Concept Mediation vs Word Association
- **Concept mediation**: L2 word → **concept** → L1 word (dominant in proficient bilinguals).  
- **Word association**: L2 word → **L1 translation** link without full conceptual access (more in beginners or time-pressured tasks).  
- Translation **asymmetries**: often **faster L1→L2** naming than L2→L1 (learning pathways; control demands).

### 🧰 Task & Learner Factors
- **Proficiency/AoA**: higher proficiency → more **direct concept access**, reduced reliance on L1 associations.  
- **Script similarity**: same-script pairs (EN–NL) show **strong orthographic** cross-talk; cross-script (ZH–EN) still show **phonological/semantic** co-activation.  
- **Language mode** (Grosjean): monolingual ↔ bilingual continuum; mode shifts **baseline activation** of each language.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 415–431 and list **two cognates** and **two false friends** for your language pair(s).  
2. **Prediction sheet**: For each of your four examples, predict **faster/slower** effects in **lexical decision** and **naming**, and **why** (BIA+ reasoning).  
3. **Mini-Stroop prep**: Review color words in L1 and L2; be ready for a quick response-time challenge.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 🎯 Stroop (Bilingual Mode) — 10 min
- Slides display color words in **L1/L2** with **ink color** mismatches (e.g., EN *GREEN* printed in red; or L2 word in L1 context).  
- Students respond **ink color**, not word.  
- **Debrief**: Which pairings slowed you down? Relate to **automatic lexical activation** across languages.

### 2) 🔤 Cognate vs Noncognate Decision — 12 min
- Paper/online set includes **cognates**, **noncognates**, and **false friends**.  
- Mark as quickly/accurately as possible whether the item “means the same in both languages.”  
- **Discussion**: Expect **cognate advantage**; identify **false-friend traps** and tie to **competition** in BIA+.

### 3) 🧠 Picture Naming & Competition — 12 min
- Rapid picture naming (L2). Insert **auditory/visual distractors**: L1 translation (facilitates? interferes?), semantically related, or unrelated.  
- **Prediction**: Translation equivalents can **prime** but also **compete**; semantically related distractors tend to **slow** naming via lexical competition.

### 4) 🗺️ BIA+ Whiteboard Build — 10 min
- In groups, draw **BIA+** for a target like EN *piano* / IT *piano*: features → letters → words; show **lateral inhibition** and **language nodes**.  
- Add **task/decision** layer (language cue, context) and propose **one manipulation** to reduce cross-language activation.

### 5) 🧪 Concept Mediation vs Word Association — 8 min
- Translate **L2→L1** and **L1→L2** low-frequency words under **speed** vs **accuracy** instructions.  
- **Debrief**: When did you feel a **direct concept route** vs a **via-L1** route?

### 6) Wrap — 3 min
- Exit slip: one **real-world scenario** where nonselective access is helpful (or harmful) for you.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: Choose one demo and explain its outcome using **BIA+** (where activation/competition arose, and the role of **language nodes**).  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: How do **script differences** (e.g., ZH–EN) change which cross-language **cues** are strongest for you?

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 11, pp. 415–431) on **cognates/false friends** and **nonselective access**.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words)**: Design a **lexical decision** mini-study with **cognates**, **false friends**, and **controls**. Specify **predictions** for each item type and **how BIA+** explains them.  
- **Optional**: Keep a two-day **code-mixing diary**; note contexts that nudge you into a more **bilingual mode**.

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** What is **nonselective lexical access** in bilinguals?  
<!-- Activation of lexical candidates from both languages during recognition, driven by shared form/meaning, even when only one language is intended. -->
<!--
**Q2.** Why do **cognates** speed recognition while **false friends** slow it?  -->
<!-- Cognates share form and meaning → converging activation; false friends share form but conflict in meaning → competition/interference in the integrated lexicon. -->
<!--
**Q3.** In **BIA+**, what roles do **language nodes** and **task/decision** components play?  -->
<!-- Language nodes index language membership and bias competition; task/decision settings (e.g., language context) modulate selection without fully blocking cross-language activation. -->
<!--
**Q4.** When is **concept mediation** more likely than **word association** in translation?  -->
<!-- With higher proficiency, deeper semantic tasks, and more time; beginners or speeded tasks may rely on direct L2→L1 links. -->
<!--
**Q5.** How can **script similarity** change cross-language effects?  -->
<!-- Same-script pairs amplify orthographic competition (more false-friend interference); cross-script pairs show less orthographic crosstalk but still phonological/semantic co-activation. -->

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore how bilinguals process and control their two (or more) languages. We look at how both languages are active during listening and speaking, how interference is managed, and what cognitive advantages might arise from bilingual experience. We also examine individual differences in language learning and the neural basis of bilingualism.

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🌐 Simultaneous Language Activation

- Bilinguals often **activate both languages** during comprehension and production.
- This leads to **competition**, especially when words share meaning or sound.
- Context (e.g., setting, speaker, topic) helps resolve competition.

### 🏗️ Shared vs. Separate Representations

- Bilinguals share **semantic representations**, but may have **distinct phonological** and **orthographic** forms.
- **Shared syntactic structures** suggest deep overlap between languages.

### ⚖️ Language Control Models

- **BIA+ (Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus)**: explains recognition across languages using a layered system.
- **Inhibitory Control Model**: bilinguals suppress the non-target language using cognitive control.

### 🧠 Bilingualism and Executive Function

- Bilinguals show **enhanced cognitive control**:
  - Inhibitory control
  - Task switching
  - Working memory
- Evidence includes **Stroop tasks** and **Simon effect** studies.

### 🎓 Second Language Learning and Variability

- Factors influencing success:
  - **Age of acquisition**
  - **Language similarity**
  - **Motivation**
  - **Exposure and use**
- Teaching methods (e.g., immersion vs. classroom) affect outcomes.

### 🧬 Neural Basis of Bilingualism

- L1 and L2 activate overlapping brain areas.
- **Proficiency** and **age of acquisition** modulate brain patterns.
- Brain adapts with experience, not just innate capacity.
