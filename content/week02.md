title: "Week 2: Speech Planning & Errors I"
tags: ["speech production", "planning", "speech errors", "lexical access"]
summary: "Examines the stages of speech planning, evidence from slips of the tongue, and models like spreading activation and lemma theory."
---


## 📘 Overview

This week we look inside the moment-to-moment planning that turns thoughts into speech.  
You’ll meet a standard **speech production architecture** (concept → words → sounds → articulation), see why **errors** are scientifically useful, and experience classic **naming tasks** that reveal the timing of semantic and phonological processes.  
We’ll also discuss **Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT)** states and what they show about the mental lexicon.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

- Sketch the **stages of speech production** (conceptualization → formulation → articulation).
- Identify and classify **speech errors** (semantic, phonological, exchange, blend, morpheme errors).
- Explain what **TOT states** reveal about separate access to meaning vs. sound forms.
- Describe key findings from **picture naming** and **picture–word interference** tasks (semantic interference, phonological facilitation).
- Explain how speakers **monitor and repair** their own speech.

---

## 📖 Required Reading

- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 2, pp. 37–51** — *Speech Production & Comprehension* (production focus for Week 2).

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 🧭 How is speech planned?

- **Levelt-style architecture**:  
  1) **Conceptualization** → 2) **Formulation** → 3) **Articulation**
- **Formulation** includes:
  - **Lexical selection** (lemma: meaning + grammar)
  - **Phonological encoding** (lexeme: sounds, syllables, stress)
- Evidence from timing and errors suggests **separable meaning and sound processes**.

---

### 💥 Speech Error Types

| Error Type | Example | What It Suggests |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| **Semantic substitution** | "cat" for "dog" | Competition at lemma/meaning level |
| **Phonological error** | "mat" for "cat" | Slip at sound level |
| **Sound exchange** (Spoonerism) | "you have hissed the mystery lectures" | Misordering in phonological planning |
| **Anticipation** | "leading list" | Early activation of upcoming sounds |
| **Perseveration** | "wabbits" for "rabbits" | Reuse of previous sounds |
| **Morpheme error** | "He has trunk-ed two packs" | Morpheme attached to wrong stem |
| **Blend** | "misunderhearing" | Joint activation of two words |

**Takeaway:** Errors aren’t random — they map to **specific processing stages**.

---

### 🧠 Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT)

- **Experience:** Know the meaning, often first letter/syllable count, but can’t retrieve the word.
- **Implication:** Access to meaning can succeed without full phonological retrieval.
- **Frequent in:** Proper names, low-frequency words, older adults.
- **Helped by:** Phonological cues (first letter/sound), number of syllables, related words.

---

### 🧪 Naming Tasks

- **Simple picture naming:**  
  Latency affected by word frequency, imageability.
- **Blocked-cyclic naming:**  
  Naming from same category → slows over cycles (**semantic interference**).
- **Picture–word interference (PWI):**  
  - **Semantically related** distractor slows naming (semantic competition).
  - **Phonologically related** distractor speeds naming (facilitation).

**Interpretation:** Semantic competition occurs early; phonological facilitation later.

---

### 🛠️ Monitoring & Repair

- **Inner loop**: Monitoring internal speech plan.  
- **Outer loop**: Listening to your own speech.  
- **Repairs**: Restarts, corrections, fillers (uh/um) to buy planning time.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities

<!--
## 📘 Overview

This week, we begin our journey into **speech production**—a process so fast and automatic we rarely notice it unless something goes wrong. How do we plan what to say? Why do we sometimes stutter, hesitate, or mix up our words?

We'll explore classic psycholinguistic findings on **speech errors**, the **tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon**, and models that explain how we formulate utterances from thoughts to articulation.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

- Describe the stages of speech production: **conceptualization**, **formulation**, and **articulation**.
- Analyze **speech errors** and what they reveal about cognitive processing.
- Explain **tip-of-the-tongue (TOT)** states using psycholinguistic evidence.
- Interpret results from **picture naming** and **word interference** studies.
- Apply theoretical models (e.g. **Levelt's WEAVER++**) to real-world speech behaviors.

---

## 📖 Required Reading

- **Chapter 2 (pp. 37–51)** from *Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science* by Matthew Traxler.

---

## 📌 Core Concepts

### 🧠 How Do We Produce Speech?

Speech production is fast and complex—averaging about **3 words per second**. According to **Levelt’s WEAVER++ model**, we move through:

1. **Conceptualization**: Deciding on the message.
2. **Formulation**: Choosing words, syntax, and sounds.
3. **Articulation**: Activating motor routines to speak.

> Example: To say “I’m hungry,” your brain retrieves meanings, selects grammar and sounds, and sends commands to your mouth—all within milliseconds.

---

### 🔄 Speech Errors as a Window into the Mind

Speech errors (slips of the tongue) occur at different levels:

| Type                | Example                                 | Explanation                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Sound exchange**   | “You have hissed all my mystery lectures” | Phoneme misplacement               |
| **Word exchange**    | “My piano plays the girlfriend”           | Syntactic formulation error         |
| **Semantic error**   | Saying “dog” instead of “cat”             | Wrong lexical concept retrieved     |

These errors are **systematic**, not random—offering clues about planning stages and mental representations.

---

### 😬 Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) Phenomena

TOT states happen when you **know** a word but can’t retrieve it—showing a disconnect between **meaning** and **form**.

- Often, people can recall:
  - First letter or syllable
  - Number of syllables
  - Similar-sounding words

TOTs reveal that word retrieval occurs in **stages**, and **phonological access** can fail while **semantic access** remains intact.

---

### 🎨 Picture Naming & Interference Tasks

In these experiments, participants name pictures while ignoring distracting words:

- **Semantic interference** (e.g., picture: apple, word: “pear”) → slower naming
- **Unrelated word** (e.g., “cloud”) → faster response

These effects show **lexical competition** during formulation.

> Key Finding: Words with similar meanings slow down word retrieval due to activation overlap.

---

<!--
## 📘 Overview

This week explores how we plan speech before articulation. You’ll learn about the stages between intention and utterance, and how **speech errors** and **TOT states** reveal the underlying architecture of our language production system. We discuss key models of speech planning, including **spreading activation** and **lemma theory**, and look at how naming tasks and interference paradigms are used to investigate production.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Stages of Speech Production

1. **Conceptualization**: forming a preverbal message
2. **Formulation**: converting concepts to linguistic structure
   - Lexical selection (choosing lemmas)
   - Morphological encoding
   - Phonological encoding
3. **Articulation**: sending instructions to motor systems
4. **Self-monitoring**: internal checking for errors

### Evidence from Speech Errors

- Speech errors are **systematic** and reflect real mental planning (not random).
- Types include:
  - **Anticipations**: “bake my bike” (take my bike)
  - **Perseverations**: “beef needle” (beef noodle)
  - **Blends**: “shout + yell = shell”
  - **Swaps**: “you have hissed all my mystery lectures”
- These suggest distinct **levels of planning**: semantic, lexical, phonological.

### Tip-of-the-Tongue (TOT) States

- You know the meaning, maybe the initial sound or number of syllables, but can’t retrieve the full word.
- TOTs show separation between **lemma** (meaning/syntax) and **lexeme** (phonological form):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

### Spreading Activation Model

- Words are stored in networks.
- Activation of one concept **spreads** to related nodes.
- Errors occur when activation spreads to a competing item (e.g., “cat” activates “dog”).
- Explains **semantic and phonological** errors, priming effects, and lexical interference:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Lemma Theory

- Distinguishes between:
  - **Lemma**: abstract representation with syntactic and semantic information.
  - **Lexeme**: actual form used in articulation.
- Speech errors and TOTs support this split:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 🧠 Chapter 2 Lecture Notes: Origins of Human Language

Where did language come from? Was it a sudden evolutionary leap or the gradual outcome of cognitive and social changes? In this chapter, we explore major theories about the biological and cultural origins of human language and the factors that set it apart from other species’ communication systems.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. Why Study Language Origins?

* Understanding language origins helps explain *why* language is the way it is.
* The origins of language remain speculative but are informed by data from archaeology, anthropology, genetics, and neuroscience.

> 🧩 **In class**: We’ll reflect on why language origin studies are challenging and what kinds of evidence count.

---

### 2. Biological Foundations of Language

#### Neurological Basis

* **Broca’s area**: associated with speech production
* **Wernicke’s area**: involved in comprehension
* Language relies on *distributed* brain systems, not a single “language center.”

#### Genetic Basis

* **FOXP2 gene**: linked to language development
* Mutations in FOXP2 can result in deficits in speech and grammar

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: FOXP2 mutations in the KE family revealed strong genetic influence on articulation and grammar, but not on general intelligence.

#### Anatomical Evidence

* **Vocal tract**: Human vocal tract shape supports a wide range of speech sounds
* **Larynx position**: Lower in humans than in apes, allowing complex vocal articulation

> 🧠 **In class**: We’ll review diagrams comparing vocal tract anatomy in humans and chimpanzees.

---

### 3. Evolutionary Hypotheses

#### Continuity vs. Discontinuity

* **Continuity hypothesis**: Language evolved gradually from pre-linguistic communication systems
* **Discontinuity hypothesis**: Language is a qualitatively different capacity that appeared suddenly

#### Gesture-First Hypothesis

* Language may have started as a **gestural** system before becoming vocal
* Supported by evidence from sign languages and mirror neurons

> 🖐️ **Cross-modal Evidence**: Sign languages have all the properties of spoken language (syntax, recursion, productivity)

#### Social and Cognitive Factors

* The rise of **symbolic thought**, **group cooperation**, and **theory of mind** likely played a role
* Language evolution may be tied to **cultural transmission** and **shared intentionality**

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll evaluate which evidence supports each hypothesis and what open questions remain.

---

### 4. What Makes Human Language Unique?

| Feature               | Human Language                    | Animal Communication   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Syntax                | Present (recursive, hierarchical) | Absent or very limited |
| Displacement          | Yes                               | Rare or absent         |
| Cultural Transmission | Strong                            | Weak to moderate       |
| Productivity          | Infinite                          | Finite                 |
| Symbolic Use          | Arbitrary symbols                 | Often iconic or fixed  |

> 🎬 **In class**: We’ll revisit animal studies (Kanzi, vervet monkeys) and assess whether they show true linguistic capacity.
