<!--

## 📘 Overview
Spoken language reaches your ears as a fast, continuous, and noisy acoustic stream—yet you understand effortlessly. This week explains **why speech perception is hard** (coarticulation, variability, no clear word boundaries) and how the mind/brain **solves** it. We’ll demo the **McGurk effect**, explore **categorical perception** of stops (ba–pa), compare **major theories** (Motor Theory, Auditory Theory, TRACE), and outline **brain systems** for speech (temporal cortex; dorsal/ventral streams).

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 4, you should be able to:

- Explain why speech perception is **non-trivial** (speed, variability, lack of invariance, segmentation).
- Describe and illustrate **coarticulation** and **categorical perception** with concrete examples.
- Compare **Motor Theory**, **Auditory Theory**, and the **TRACE model** and state one prediction each.
- Explain the **McGurk effect** and why visual information influences what we hear.
- Identify key **brain areas/streams** involved in speech perception and their roles.

---

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 2, pp. 51–71** — *Speech Perception*.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🧩 Why Speech Perception Is Hard
- **Speed & continuity:** ~10–15 phonemes/second; no consistent pauses between words.
- **Acoustic variability:** Same phoneme differs across speakers, rates, emotions, and contexts.
- **Coarticulation:** Overlap of gestures so sounds influence each other (anticipatory & carryover).
- **Lack of invariance:** No one-to-one mapping from acoustic pattern to phoneme.
- **Segmentation problem:** Brain must infer word boundaries from context, stress, and knowledge.

### 🔄 Coarticulation
- **Definition:** Neighboring sounds overlap; current articulation anticipates upcoming segments.  
- **Example:** /k/ in **key** (fronted) vs **coo** (backed) changes the burst formant transitions.  
- **Implication:** Perceivers use context (surrounding vowels/places of articulation) to interpret ambiguous cues.

### 🎚️ Categorical Perception
- **Definition:** A continuous acoustic continuum (e.g., Voice Onset Time, VOT) is heard in **discrete categories** (e.g., /b/ vs /p/).  
- **Classic finding:** Sharp identification boundary and better discrimination **across** category boundary than **within** a category.  
- **Why useful:** Supports robust understanding despite acoustic variability.

### 🎬 The McGurk Effect (Audiovisual Integration)
- **Phenomenon:** Seeing **/ga/** dubbed onto **/ba/** often leads to hearing **/da/**.  
- **Takeaway:** Visual speech (lip movements) powerfully shapes auditory perception; effect grows in noise.

### 🧠 Theories of Speech Perception
- **Motor Theory:** We perceive **intended articulatory gestures**. Explains audiovisual influences (e.g., McGurk) and links to motor activation, but struggles with non-speech/perception in infants & animals.  
- **Auditory (General) Theory:** Speech perception relies on **general auditory mechanisms** (not speech-specific). Supported by categorical-like effects in infants/animals; must account for context and visual influences.  
- **TRACE Model:** Interactive **connectionist** model with **features–phonemes–words**; supports **top-down** effects (e.g., Ganong effect: bias toward real words) and **bottom-up** accumulation. Predicts context can shift phoneme perception.

### 🧬 The Brain: Areas & Streams
- **Superior temporal gyrus (STG)/superior temporal sulcus (STS):** early speech-sensitive processing and audiovisual integration.  
- **Wernicke’s area (posterior superior temporal):** speech comprehension; damage → fluent aphasia (fluent speech with poor comprehension).  
- **Dual-Stream Model:**  
  - **Ventral (“what”)**: maps sounds → meanings (recognition, comprehension).  
  - **Dorsal (“how”)**: maps sounds → articulatory representations (imitation, repetition).

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 51–71. Highlight: coarticulation examples, categorical perception graphs, McGurk explanation, theory summaries.  
2. **Quick listen:** Find two recordings of the **same word** by different speakers (YouTube or phone recordings). Note acoustic differences you notice.  
3. **Optional (2–3 min video):** Watch a short **McGurk effect** clip to prime your intuition.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) Categorical Perception Demo (10 min)
- Listen to a **ba–pa VOT continuum** (instructor-provided audio).  
- Individually mark where your **category boundary** falls; compare with neighbors.  
- Discuss: Why do we perceive a **sharp switch** despite gradual acoustic change?

### 2) Coarticulation Lab (12 min)
- Pair up and record each other saying **“key”** vs **“coo”**, **“boot”** vs **“beat.”**  
- Listen back: describe differences in the **/k/** burst quality and formant transitions; relate to **anticipatory** coarticulation.  
- Share one observation with the class.

### 3) McGurk + Lipreading Challenge (15 min)
- Watch a **McGurk effect** video (with/without sound).  
- **Lipreading mini-task:** Instructor silently mouths a short phrase; students write what they think they “heard.”  
- Discuss: When did visual cues help or hurt? Connect to **noisy environments** and **L2 listening**.

### 4) Theory Triads (15 min)
- Groups of three: each person briefly **champions** one theory (**Motor**, **Auditory**, **TRACE**).  
- Apply your theory to explain: **(a)** McGurk effect, **(b)** categorical perception, **(c)** Ganong effect (bias toward real words).  
- As a group, write one **prediction** your theory makes about perception **in noise** or **with strong context**.

### 5) Noisy Room Challenge (10 min)
- One student reads a sentence list while teammates create **background noise** (whispered chatter or soft music).  
- Listeners transcribe best guesses; repeat while **watching the talker’s face**.  
- Compare accuracy: audio-only vs audiovisual. What improved and why?

### 6) Quick Wrap (3 min)
- On a sticky note: write **one insight** about **audiovisual integration** and **one question** to revisit.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **Sketch** a one-page comparison: **Motor vs Auditory vs TRACE** (key idea, 1 strength, 1 limitation, 1 prediction).  
- **Reflect (100–120 words):** When do **visual cues** help you most in English listening? Any times they mislead?  
- **Bonus:** Try the **Laurel/Yanny** clip and explain (briefly) why people disagree.

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** items on **coarticulation**, **categorical perception**, and **McGurk** (from pp. 51–71 section).  
- **Short write-up (≈150 words):** Based on the Noisy Room Challenge, argue **which theory** best explains your results and **why**. Use one concrete observation.

## 📘 Overview

How do we recognize a word—faster than the blink of an eye—and retrieve its meaning from our mental lexicon? This week, we explore how the brain matches sounds or letters to stored words, and what factors influence how fast and accurately we do this. We’ll also examine classic experiments like **lexical decision tasks** and **semantic priming**, and learn how computational models try to explain how words are accessed in real time.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of **lexical access** and how words are retrieved from memory.
- Describe how **lexical decision** and **semantic priming** tasks reveal patterns in word processing.
- Understand how factors like **word frequency**, **neighborhood density**, and **context** influence word recognition.
- Compare key **models of lexical access**, including **logogen**, **cohort**, and **interactive activation** models.

## 📖 Required Reading

- **Chapter 3 (pp. 79–113)** from *Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science* by Matthew Traxler.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 📚 What Is Lexical Access?

- **Lexical access** refers to the process of recognizing a word and retrieving its meaning and sound from the mental lexicon.
- This involves:
  - **Activation** of candidate words.
  - **Selection** of the correct word from similar alternatives.
  - **Integration** with the sentence or context.

---

### ⚡ Lexical Decision Task

- Participants decide if a string of letters is a real word or not (e.g., *table* vs. *blafe*).
- **Key finding**: Response times are faster for:
  - **High-frequency words** than low-frequency ones.
  - **Words preceded by related words** (e.g., *doctor → nurse*).

**Example**:  
You’ll respond faster to *“bread”* if you just saw *“butter.”*

---

### 🧠 Semantic Priming

- When a word is processed more quickly because it's related in meaning to a previous word.
- Shows how **concepts are interconnected** in the mental lexicon.

**Classic study**: Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971)  
- Faster responses for semantically related word pairs (*nurse-doctor*) than unrelated ones (*nurse-butter*).

---

### 🔠 Word Frequency & Neighborhood Effects

- **Frequency effect**: Common words like *book* are accessed faster than rare words like *niche*.
- **Orthographic neighbors**: Words that differ by one letter (e.g., *book*, *look*, *cook*).
  - **Dense neighborhoods** can speed up or slow down access depending on context.
- **Phonological neighbors**: Sound-based overlap (e.g., *cat*, *cap*, *cab*).

---

### 🧬 Models of Word Recognition

| Model                   | Key Features                                                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Logogen Model**       | Each word has a threshold-based unit; frequency lowers the threshold. |
| **Cohort Model**        | Word recognition begins from the first sound and narrows down options. |
| **Interactive Activation Model** | Uses letter and word layers with top-down and bottom-up activation. |

## 🔜 Coming Up Next

Next week, we dive deeper into **how we understand word meanings** and the role of **context** and **ambiguity** in the brain’s interpretation process.

-->






<!--
## 📘 Overview

This week focuses on how words are **represented**, **stored**, and **retrieved** in the mind. We examine various models of the **mental lexicon**, how meaning is structured, and how the mind retrieves lexical items efficiently. You’ll learn about traditional **associationist theories**, the **symbol grounding problem**, and **embodied semantics**, as well as first- to third-generation computational models.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is a Word?

- Psycholinguists distinguish between:
  - **Lexeme**: the form of the word (e.g., “run,” “ran,” “runs”)
  - **Lemma**: an abstract entry in the lexicon with semantic/syntactic info
- Words have **semantic**, **syntactic**, and **phonological** properties that are processed in different stages.

---

### Lexical Semantics

- Focuses on how word meanings are **represented and structured** in memory.
- Words are **linked by meaning, context, and usage** (e.g., “dog” → “bark”, “bone”).

---

### Associationist Models

- **HAL (Hyperspace Analogue to Language)** and **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)** represent meaning based on **co-occurrence** in language.
- Meaning is derived from **distributional patterns** across contexts:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- These models help explain **priming effects**, **semantic distance**, and **category structure**.

---

### The Symbol Grounding Problem

- How do symbols (e.g., words) connect to real-world experiences?
- Purely symbolic models (like HAL/LSA) struggle to explain **how symbols acquire meaning**.

---

### Embodied Semantics

- Suggests meanings are grounded in **sensorimotor experiences**.
- E.g., understanding “kick” involves partial activation of brain areas associated with **motor planning for the legs**.
- Supported by neuroimaging studies showing **motor cortex involvement** in language comprehension:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Lexical Access Models

| Generation | Features |
|------------|----------|
| **First** | Serial search models: words are retrieved by scanning a list of candidates (like dictionary lookup) |
| **Second** | Frequency-based access: high-frequency words are accessed faster (logogen model) |
| **Third** | Distributed models: words are activated in **parallel**, with activation levels depending on frequency and context |

- Third-generation models combine features from earlier approaches and handle **ambiguity, priming, and prediction** better:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

---

## 📚 Reading

- Traxler (2012), Chapter 3: *Word Processing* (pp. 79–113)

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Lexeme** | The morphological/phonological form of a word |
| **Lemma** | A mental representation of a word's syntactic and semantic information |
| **Associationist Model** | Theories that represent meaning via word co-occurrence and proximity in vector space |
| **Symbol Grounding Problem** | The challenge of linking abstract symbols to real-world referents |
| **Embodied Semantics** | The view that meaning is grounded in sensory and motor systems |
| **Lexical Access** | The process of retrieving a word from memory during comprehension or production |

---

## 🧪 Examples & In-Class Activities

### 🧠 Word Web Brainstorm

- Given a target word (e.g., “apple”), students quickly generate related words.
- Use to demonstrate **semantic networks** and **priming**.

### 🖼️ HAL vs. Embodiment Demo

- Students sort words by co-occurrence (text-based) vs. experience (sensorimotor).
- Discussion: what’s missing from co-occurrence models?

### 💬 Priming Reaction Task

- Present pairs like “doctor–nurse” and “bread–nurse.”
- Measure how semantic relatedness speeds up response time.

### 🧪 Lexical Access Simulation

- Simulate lexical activation using cards or diagrams:
  - “cat” activates “dog,” “fur,” “meow,” etc.
  - Show how **frequency**, **context**, and **ambiguity** shape activation.

## ❓ Self-Check Questions

1. What is the difference between a lemma and a lexeme?
2. How do HAL and LSA models explain word meaning?
3. What is the symbol grounding problem, and how do embodied accounts address it?
4. Compare first-, second-, and third-generation models of lexical access.

## 🧠 Chapter 4 Lecture Notes: Language Acquisition II

In this chapter, we explore the development of more complex linguistic structures in children’s speech — especially grammar, morphology, and syntax. We also examine what overregularization errors and bilingual development can reveal about the nature of language learning.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. Grammatical Development

* Children move from two-word combinations to more structured utterances
* **Syntactic bootstrapping**: using sentence structure to infer word meaning
* Early word order patterns show awareness of grammar (e.g., “Mommy sock” = “Mommy has a sock” or “Put the sock on Mommy”)

> 📈 Children’s utterances gradually become more adult-like but reflect creative rule-building

> 🧠 **In class**: We’ll trace the growth of sentence length and complexity using transcript examples.

---

### 2. Morphological Development

#### Inflectional Morphology

* Regular past tense: “walked,” “played”
* Irregular forms: “went,” “broke”

> 🧩 **Overregularization**:
>
> * Children apply regular rules to irregular verbs (e.g., “goed,” “runned”)
> * Evidence that children internalize rules, not just imitate

#### Derivational Morphology

* Forming new words from existing ones (e.g., “teacher” from “teach”)
* Acquired later than inflectional morphology

> 🎧 **In class**: We’ll listen to recordings of overregularization and discuss what they reveal about internal rule systems.

---

### 3. Negative and Question Formation

* Children begin by placing negation at sentence edges (e.g., “No go outside”)
* Question development:

  * Stage 1: Rising intonation only (“You want juice?”)
  * Stage 2: Use of auxiliaries and inversion (“Can I go?”)

> 🧠 Errors like “Why she can’t go?” are systematic and reflect transitional grammar stages.

---

### 4. Bilingual Language Acquisition

* Simultaneous bilingualism: acquiring two languages from birth
* Sequential bilingualism: learning a second language after establishing the first
* Children often code-switch — combine elements from both languages — but do so systematically

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: Bilingual infants can separate languages by rhythm and intonation before they can speak.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll analyze bilingual transcripts and examine code-switching patterns.

---

### 5. Input, Feedback, and the Role of Caregivers

* Caregivers rarely correct grammar directly — but they provide feedback through recasts (reformulations)
* **Implicit correction**: “Her goed to the store” → “Yes, she went to the store.”
* Quantity and quality of input shape grammatical development

---
