## 📘 Overview

This week, we explore how people process language that **doesn’t mean exactly what it says**, including metaphors, idioms, and metonymy. We’ll review theoretical models, evidence from behavioral and neuroscience studies, and the role of **context** and **embodied cognition** in interpreting figurative expressions.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Types of Nonliteral Language

- **Metaphor**: "My lawyer is a shark."
- **Metonymy**: "The White House issued a statement."
- **Idioms**: "Kick the bucket", "Spill the beans"
- **Underspecified expressions**: Ambiguity invites inferencing.

---

### The Standard Pragmatic View

- **Literal meaning first**, then **nonliteral reinterpretation** if needed.
- Comprehension involves:
  1. Accessing literal meaning
  2. Detecting anomaly or inconsistency
  3. Reanalyzing to arrive at nonliteral interpretation
- Challenge: Empirical evidence shows **figurative meaning can be accessed directly** in context:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### The Career of Metaphor Hypothesis

- Metaphors evolve with familiarity:
  - **Novel metaphors** require comparison and mapping.
  - **Conventional metaphors** are processed more like **categorical statements**.
- E.g., "The mind is a computer" (novel) → "He’s burning the candle at both ends" (conventional):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Embodied Cognition and Metaphor

- Understanding metaphors may involve **sensorimotor systems**.
- "Grasping the idea" may activate **grasping-related motor areas** in the brain.
- Suggests **semantic processing is grounded in perception and action** systems.

---

### Idioms and Frozen Metaphors

- Idioms have **fixed forms and meanings**, often processed as **chunks**.
- Processing depends on:
  - **Transparency** (How easily literal meaning suggests figurative meaning)
  - **Familiarity**
- Can be stored **lexically** or **constructed compositionally** depending on usage.

---

### Neural Basis of Figurative Language

- fMRI and ERP studies show:
  - **Right hemisphere** more involved in novel metaphor and joke processing.
  - **Left hemisphere** handles conventionalized expressions.
- Brain areas involved: **Inferior frontal gyrus**, **posterior temporal lobe**, **motor cortex** (for embodied metaphors):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Metaphor** | Understanding one thing in terms of another |
| **Metonymy** | Referring to something by a related concept |
| **Idiom** | Fixed phrase with figurative meaning |
| **Embodied Cognition** | Idea that understanding is grounded in physical experience |
| **Career of Metaphor** | Development from novel to conventional metaphor usage |

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🎭 Metaphor Generation Game

- Pairs generate metaphors for abstract concepts like **time**, **emotion**, **power**.
- Class votes on which are **conventional**, **novel**, or **mixed**.

### 🧩 Idiom Matching Task

- Students match idioms with their literal equivalents and explain **transparency**.
- Discussion: Are idioms stored or interpreted on the fly?

### 🧠 Embodiment Demonstration

- Students read sentences like “She grasped the concept” or “He kicked the idea around.”
- Reflect on physical sensations or imagery involved in interpretation.
