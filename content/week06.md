## 📘 Overview
When you read or hear a word like **bank**, your brain must rapidly choose the right meaning (money? river?). This week explores **how word meaning is represented and selected**, how **context** and **frequency/bias** guide **ambiguity resolution**, how meanings are linked in **semantic networks**, and what **brain measures** (like the **N400**) tell us about semantic processing. We’ll analyze ambiguous sentences, build small semantic networks, and discuss how L1/L2 experience shapes meaning access.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 6, you should be able to:

- Distinguish **homonymy** vs **polysemy** and explain why it matters for processing.
- Describe how **frequency/bias** and **context** influence **lexical ambiguity resolution**.
- Explain core ideas of **semantic network** organization (feature overlap, associative links).
- Interpret classic **priming** and **N400** findings as evidence for semantic activation.
- Apply these ideas to analyze ambiguous sentences in English and compare with Chinese.

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 3, pp. 113–129** — *Word Processing* (meaning and semantic access).

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🧭 Homonymy vs. Polysemy
- **Homonymy**: *bank* (money) vs *bank* (river) — **unrelated** meanings share form.  
- **Polysemy**: *paper* (material / newspaper / article) — **related** senses share a core concept.  
- **Processing note**: Polysemous words often show **processing advantages** (shared core features), while homonyms rely more on **context** to select the right entry.

### 🎯 Ambiguity Resolution
- **Meaning dominance (bias)**: Common senses (e.g., *bank–money*) are selected more quickly than rare senses (*bank–river*) unless **strong context** flips the bias.  
- **Context timing**: **Early** supportive context can pre-activate the appropriate meaning; **late** context forces re-interpretation (slower, more errors).  
- **Subordinate-bias effect**: Rare meanings need **clear cues**; without them, readers/listeners default to dominant senses.

### 🌐 Semantic Networks & Features
- Words are linked by **category** (CAT–DOG), **association** (BREAD–BUTTER), and **shared features** (BIRD–BAT: wings/flies).  
- **Spreading activation**: Seeing *doctor* partially activates *nurse*, speeding recognition (**semantic priming**).  
- **Feature verification**: True-feature decisions (e.g., “A robin has wings”) are faster than less typical ones (“A penguin has wings”).

### 🧠 Brain Signatures of Meaning
- **N400** (ERP component): larger (more negative) around ~400 ms for **semantic mismatches** (e.g., “He spread the warm bread with **socks**”).  
- **Context reduces N400**: predictable words elicit **smaller** N400s; unrelated or anomalous words elicit **larger** ones.  
- **Regions** (big picture): temporal-parietal areas (e.g., **posterior temporal**, **angular gyrus**) often implicated in semantic integration; **anterior temporal** supports conceptual combination.

### 🧩 L1–L2 & Cross-Linguistic Notes
- **Chinese homophones** (音同形不同) can increase ambiguity; characters disambiguate in writing.  
- **English polysemy** (e.g., metaphorical extensions) may require more context for L2 learners.  
- Strategy: attend to **local cues** (adjacent words) and **global topic** to bias the right sense.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 113–129 and list **three ambiguous words** you encountered (mark **dominant** vs **subordinate** meanings).  
2. **Mini network**: Choose one target (e.g., *head*) and draw **8 connected nodes** (category, parts, uses, metaphors).  
3. **Quick sentences**: Write two short contexts for *bank* that **unambiguously** force each meaning (money vs river).

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) Ambiguity Lab: Dominant vs Subordinate (15 min)
- **Pairs**: Classify 12 sentences by intended sense (homonymy set: *bank, bark, bat, match*).  
- **Task**: Decide if context is **strong/weak**, and whether a dominant or subordinate sense is selected.  
- **Predict**: Which will take longer to understand? (Subordinate with weak context).

**Sample set**  
1. *The hikers sat on the bank and watched the fish.*  
2. *I deposited my paycheck at the bank after class.*  
3. *The guard saw a bat fly out of the cave.*  
4. *The batter held the bat tightly and swung.*  
5. *The dog’s bark echoed across the yard.*  
6. *The pine’s bark protects it from insects.*  
7. *We lit the match and the candle flickered.*  
8. *It was a perfect match between the two finalists.*

### 2) Context Strength Challenge (12 min)
- **Groups of 3–4**: Rewrite **two** weak-context items to **strongly bias** the subordinate sense (e.g., *bank–river*).  
- **Share** and **vote**: Which context makes the subordinate sense most obvious?

### 3) Semantic Network Sprint (12 min)
- **Teams** build a network for **one target** (e.g., *head*, *light*, *spring*).  
- Include: **category**, **parts**, **actions**, **associations**, **metaphors**.  
- Add **three edges** that explain likely **priming** routes (why would A speed B?).

### 4) N400 Thought Experiment (8 min)
- **Pairs**: For each sentence stem, choose a **predictable**, **related-but-odd**, and **anomalous** completion.  
- **Predict** N400 size (small ↔ large) and justify.

**Stems**  
- *She stirred her coffee with a…*  
- *After the marathon, he drank a bottle of…*  
- *They decorated the cake with…*

### 5) Whole-Class Discussion (8 min)
- Why is **polysemy** often easier than **homonymy**?  
- When does **context** arrive too late to prevent confusion?  
- L2 angle: Which cues do you rely on first in English?

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: Explain the **subordinate-bias effect** with one example from class and one you found yourself.  
- **Network tidy-up**: Redraw your semantic network more clearly (show **strong vs weak** links).  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: Describe a moment when context **rescued** you from a wrong meaning.

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 3, pp. 113–129): items on ambiguity and semantic access.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words)**: Compare **homonymy vs polysemy** using two words from class; predict differences in processing and N400 patterns.  
- **Optional mini-priming**: Create 6 prime–target pairs (2 semantic, 2 associative, 2 unrelated). Ask a friend to read targets after primes; collect subjective “fast/slow” ratings and summarize.

## 🧩 Overview

This week we begin exploring **sentence processing**—how we comprehend sentences in real time. You'll learn about **parsing**, **garden-path sentences**, and the strategies readers and listeners use to interpret ambiguous structures. We'll also examine how researchers study these processes using reaction times and eye-tracking.

-->

<!-- 
## 📘 Core Topics

- The challenge of **incremental parsing**
- Temporary ambiguity and **garden-path effects**
- Two-stage parsing models:
  - **Syntax-first approach**
  - **Constraint-based approach**
- Empirical methods in sentence processing

---

## ❓ Guiding Questions

- What strategies do we use to parse sentences as we read or listen?
- Why do some sentences lead us down the wrong path?
- How does the brain decide between multiple syntactic interpretations?
- What evidence supports the idea that meaning and context influence parsing?

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

### Garden-Path Sentences
- Sentences that start off seeming to mean one thing but end up meaning another.
- Example:  
  *“The horse raced past the barn fell.”*  
  Initially misparsed due to temporary ambiguity.

### Parsing Models

#### Syntax-First (Two-Stage) Model
- Proposed by **Frazier & Rayner (1982)**.
- Initial parsing is based solely on syntactic structure.
- Semantics and context are used **only afterward** to revise incorrect parses.

#### Constraint-Based Models
- Parsing is influenced from the start by **multiple sources** of information: syntax, semantics, frequency, and context.
- Considers **probabilistic cues** and parallel representations.

### Empirical Evidence
- Eye-tracking and self-paced reading show increased processing time at disambiguation points in garden-path sentences.
- The more unexpected a structure is, the more reanalysis is needed.

---

## 🧠 Before Class

### 1. Pre-Reading Prompt  
Read these two sentences:
- *“The old man the boats.”*
- *“While the man hunted the deer ran into the woods.”*

Try to explain why they are difficult to understand at first.

### 2. Think About
- What strategies do you use when a sentence doesn't make sense immediately?
- Can you think of a time when you misunderstood someone due to how they phrased something?

---

## 🏫 In-Class Activities

### 🧪 Garden-Path Sentence Game
- Identify and fix misparsed garden-path sentences in groups.
- Use provided sentence strips with ambiguities to test each other.

### 🔍 Parsing Strategy Debate
- Split into two teams:
  - One defends the **syntax-first** view.
  - One supports the **constraint-based** approach.
- Use examples from the textbook to support your case.

### 🧠 Parsing Demo
- Read aloud ambiguous sentences.
- Students press a key or raise hands when they feel confusion or reanalysis is needed.
- Discuss what made certain parts harder to process.

---

## 📝 After Class

### 1. Review Questions
- What is the difference between a syntax-first and a constraint-based model?
- Why do garden-path sentences confuse us?
- What kinds of information (besides syntax) help us parse sentences in real time?

### 2. Practice Task
Write two of your own garden-path sentences. Try to trick a friend! Then explain where the ambiguity lies and how it resolves.

## 🧠 Summary

> Sentence processing is rapid, incremental, and sometimes error-prone. The brain uses different strategies—some focused on syntactic structure, others more holistic—to interpret sentence meaning as it unfolds. Garden-path effects reveal the dynamic nature of parsing and the influence of context.

<!--
## 📘 Overview

When we read or hear a sentence, our brain rapidly organizes words into grammatical structure—a process known as **parsing**. This week introduces the classic models of how parsing works, explores **garden-path sentences**, and compares **modular (two-stage)** and **interactive (constraint-based)** approaches. We also discuss how frequency, semantics, prosody, and visual context guide real-time sentence comprehension.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Is Parsing?

- Parsing is the **unconscious process** of assigning **syntactic structure** to incoming linguistic input.
- The parser must resolve **temporary ambiguities** and do so **incrementally**—word by word.

---

### Garden-Path Sentences

- Ambiguities lead to **misanalysis** during parsing:
  > “The horse raced past the barn fell.”  
- Requires **reanalysis**, which increases processing time.

---

### Two-Stage Models (Modular Parsing)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Syntax-first** | Parsing is guided by grammatical structure alone, before semantics or context intervene. |
| **Minimal Attachment** | Choose the parse with **fewest nodes** (simplest structure). |
| **Late Closure** | Attach new words to the **current phrase** if possible. |
| **Serial** | Only one parse is pursued at a time. Reanalysis happens when it fails. |

- Empirical support: eye-tracking shows longer fixations when initial parse fails.

---

### Constraint-Based Models (Interactive Parsing)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multiple constraints** | Parsing is influenced by **syntax, semantics, frequency, discourse**, etc. |
| **Parallel processing** | Multiple interpretations are considered simultaneously. |
| **Probabilistic** | Readers/listeners evaluate likelihoods based on prior experience. |

- Supported by studies showing that **frequency** of verb argument structure, **story context**, and **visual scenes** can affect initial parse:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### Key Influences on Parsing

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Story Context** | Helps disambiguate otherwise ambiguous sentences |
| **Verb Subcategorization Frequency** | Frequent syntactic frames are preferred |
| **Prosody** | Intonation affects syntactic grouping in spoken language |
| **Semantic Plausibility** | Meaning constraints bias interpretation |
| **Visual Context** | Real-world scenes affect syntactic interpretation (e.g., Tanenhaus et al.)
