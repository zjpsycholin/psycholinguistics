## 📘 Overview
This week extends our view of bilingual processing to **language control and switching**. We examine why switching from **L2→L1** can be **harder** than L1→L2 (the **asymmetric switch-cost** pattern), when costs can become **symmetric** (proficiency/task context), and what **code-switching** reveals about control in natural conversation. We also look at **structural priming across languages** as evidence for **shared syntactic representations**, and we connect behavior to the **brain** using core findings from **fMRI/ERP** on bilingual control.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 15, you should be able to:

- Describe **asymmetric switch costs** and explain them using an **inhibitory-control** account.
- Identify conditions that yield **symmetric** or reduced switch costs (e.g., high proficiency, intense mixing mode).
- Explain **reversed dominance** (L2 outperforming L1 under strong L1 inhibition).
- Summarize evidence for **shared syntax** via **cross-language structural priming**.
- Interpret basic **neuroimaging** signatures of bilingual control (ACC, DLPFC, basal ganglia; ERP N2/P3 modulation).
- Analyze short **code-switching** samples for control demands, triggers, and comprehension effects.

---

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 11, pp. 431–447** — *Bilingual Language Processing* (language control, switching costs, code-switching, structural priming across languages, neural evidence).

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🔄 Language Switching & Control
- **Asymmetric switch costs**: Switching **L2→L1** is often **slower** than L1→L2 because L1 must be **suppressed** to allow L2 production; lifting strong L1 inhibition is costly.  
- **Symmetric costs** can emerge with **balanced proficiency**, heavy **mixing**, or tasks that minimize L1 dominance.
- **Reversed dominance**: In some mixed-language contexts, performance can be **better in L2** than L1 if L1 remains **strongly inhibited** across trials.

### 🧠 Inhibitory Control & Alternatives
- **Inhibitory Control view**: A domain-general control system down-regulates the **non-target** language to reduce competition; switch trials require **reconfiguration**, yielding costs.
- **Task factors** (cue reliability, response deadlines, stimulus type) and **learner factors** (proficiency, AoA) modulate how much inhibition is applied.

### 🗣️ Code-Switching (Naturalistic)
- Switching reflects **control** interacting with **pragmatics** (addressee, topic, emphasis) and **availability** (recent activation, lexical access).  
- Comprehenders usually keep both languages partially active; **integration** is smoother when switches align with **phrase boundaries** and predictable **discourse** points.

### 🧩 Structural Priming Across Languages
- Producing/comprehending a structure in one language (e.g., **passive**) increases the chance of using/comprehending the **same structure** in the other language shortly after.  
- Supports **shared** or **closely linked** **syntactic representations**, not two entirely separate grammars in use.

### 🧲 Brain Signatures of Control
- **fMRI**: **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)** and **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** recruit during conflict/monitoring; **basal ganglia/caudate** implicated in language selection/switching.  
- **ERP**: Increased **N2** (conflict/monitoring) and **P3** (updating) on switch or conflict trials; component sizes modulated by **proficiency** and **context**.  
- With experience, neural responses can show **efficiency** (reduced effort for common switches).

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 431–447 and list: one example of **asymmetric cost**, one **code-switch** you’ve heard/used, and one **imaging or ERP** finding.  
2. **Prediction sheet**: Will you show **reversed dominance** in a mixing task? Why (based on your L1/L2 strengths)?  
3. **Priming prep**: Write two sentence pairs (EN↔ZH or your L2) using the **same structure** (e.g., active/passive) to test **cross-language priming**.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 🔄 Color-Cued Switching (12 min)
- Name digits/pictures; **blue = L1**, **green = L2**. Measure **switch** vs **stay** trials (paper timing or browser timer).  
- **Debrief**: Do you see **L2→L1** cost > L1→L2? Any **reversed dominance**?

### 2) 🧪 Translation Stroop (10 min)
- Name ink color while words are **color terms** in **L1 or L2** (or translations).  
- Expect **interference** when word meaning conflicts with ink; compare L1 vs L2 magnitudes.

### 3) 🧠 Structural Priming Across Languages (12 min)
- Read/produce a prime sentence in **Language A**; immediately produce a description in **Language B**.  
- Tally **same-structure** uses; discuss how this supports **shared syntax**.

### 4) 🗺️ Code-Switch Clinic (12 min)
- Short transcribed snippets (2–3 switches each). Label **switch points** and infer **control demands** (lexical retrieval, emphasis, addressee shift).  
- Note when a switch **helps** (retrieval) vs **hurts** (integration cost).

### 5) 🧠 Brain Map Quickmatch (11 min)
- Match findings to regions/components: **ACC**, **DLPFC**, **basal ganglia/caudate**, **N2**, **P3**.  
- Propose one reason **proficiency** would **reduce** activation for a given contrast.

### 6) Wrap (3 min)
- Exit slip: one **task tweak** that would **reduce** your switch costs.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: Explain your switching results with **Inhibitory Control** (where inhibition was applied, how it produced asymmetry/symmetry).  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: In which real settings do you **choose** to code-switch? Does it feel like effort or relief? Why?

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 11, pp. 431–447) on **switching**, **control**, and **priming**.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words)**: Design a **language-switching** task that tests for **reversed dominance**. Specify **cues**, **trial structure**, and **predictions** for high- vs low-proficiency bilinguals.  
- **Optional**: Keep a 24-hour **code-switch diary**; categorize each switch (addressee/topic/lexical retrieval).

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** Why is **L2→L1** often slower than **L1→L2** in switching tasks?  
<!-- Because L1 is strongly inhibited to allow L2 production; removing that inhibition on a switch back to L1 is costly (asymmetric switch cost). -->
<!--
**Q2.** Name a condition that can make switch costs **symmetric**.  -->
<!-- Higher/balanced proficiency or sustained mixed-language context that reduces L1 dominance (both languages similarly activated). -->
<!--
**Q3.** What is **reversed dominance**?  -->
<!-- When performance in L2 surpasses L1 under persistent L1 inhibition in mixed-language contexts. -->
<!--
**Q4.** How does **cross-language structural priming** support **shared syntax**? --> 
<!-- Using the same structure across languages after a prime suggests linked or shared syntactic representations rather than fully separate grammars in use. -->
<!--
**Q5.** Which regions/components are commonly linked to **bilingual control** and **switching**?  -->
<!-- ACC/DLPFC (conflict/monitoring), basal ganglia/caudate (selection/switching), ERP N2 (conflict) and P3 (updating). -->

## 📘 Overview

This week we examine sign languages as fully expressive natural languages. We discuss their phonological, morphological, and syntactic structures; how they are processed in the brain; and how they are acquired. We also explore cognitive consequences of deafness, the role of the right hemisphere, and issues related to cochlear implants.
