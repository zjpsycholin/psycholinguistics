<!--
## 📘 Overview
Everyday conversation seems effortless, but it relies on powerful **pragmatic principles** and **interactive routines**. This week introduces **Grice’s Cooperative Principle and maxims**, **conversational implicature** (including **scalar implicatures**), **speech acts** (direct vs indirect), and core structures of dialogue: **turn-taking**, **adjacency pairs**, and **repair**. We’ll also touch on **common ground** and **audience design**—how speakers tailor messages for specific listeners.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 10, you should be able to:

- State **Grice’s Cooperative Principle** and the four **Maxims**; diagnose **violations** vs **floutings** and infer the likely **implicature**.
- Explain **conversational implicature** vs **entailment** and why implicatures are **cancelable**.
- Define **scalar implicature** (e.g., *some → not all*) and show how **context** strengthens or cancels it.
- Identify **speech acts** (locutionary/illocutionary/perlocutionary) and rewrite **direct** as **indirect** requests politely.
- Recognize **turn-taking cues**, **adjacency pairs**, and common **repair** formats in dialogue.
- Describe **common ground**/**audience design** and give one partner-specific adaptation example.

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🤝 Cooperative Principle & Gricean Maxims
- **Cooperative Principle**: “Make your contribution such as is required… by the accepted purpose of the talk exchange.”
- **Maxims**  
  - **Quantity**: Be as informative as needed, no more or less.  
  - **Quality**: Do not say what you believe to be false; don’t assert without evidence.  
  - **Relation** (*Relevance*): Be relevant.  
  - **Manner**: Be clear, brief, orderly; avoid ambiguity.
- **Flouting** (overtly breaking a maxim) often **signals an implicature** (e.g., irony, understatement).

**Example**  
A: *How was the exam?*  
B: *Well, the room was very comfortable.* → Flouts **Relation**; implicates “it didn’t go well.”

---

### 🕵️ Conversational Implicature
- **Implicature**: meaning inferred from **maxim-guided reasoning**, not explicitly stated.  
- **Cancelability**: “Some students passed—**in fact, all did**.” (implicature *not all* is canceled)  
- **Entailment vs Implicature**: Entailments follow from **truth conditions** and **cannot** be canceled without contradiction.

---

### 📏 Scalar Implicature
- **Scales**: ⟨all, most, many, some⟩; ⟨always, often, sometimes⟩; ⟨must, should, may⟩.  
- Saying a **weaker** term (e.g., *some*) implicates the stronger is **not** satisfied (*not all*), **unless** context cancels it.  
- **Strengtheners**: numerals, explicit upper bounds, contrastive stress, corrective follow-ups.

**Mini-contrast**  
- *Some of the files uploaded successfully* → typically implicates *not all*.  
- *At least some of the files uploaded* → weaker commitment; implicature softened.

---

### 🎭 Speech Acts (Direct vs Indirect)
- **Locutionary** (literal form), **Illocutionary** (intended act: request, offer), **Perlocutionary** (effect on listener).  
- **Direct**: *Close the window.*  
- **Indirect**: *Could you close the window?* / *It’s a bit cold in here.* (relies on shared norms and politeness).  
- **Felicity conditions**: speaker’s authority/ability, appropriateness, sincerity.

---

### 🔁 Turn-Taking, Adjacency Pairs, and Repair
- **Turn-taking**: listeners use **TRPs** (intonation, syntax completion, gaze) to enter; **backchannels** (*uh-huh,嗯*) signal attention.  
- **Adjacency pairs**: **Q–A**, **Greeting–Greeting**, **Offer–Acceptance/Refusal**; “preferred” responses (e.g., acceptance) are quicker and simpler than dispreferred (refusals → delays, hedges).  
- **Repair**:  
  - **Self-initiated self-repair**: *I went to Bei— I mean, **Beijing**.*  
  - **Other-initiated repair**: *Sorry?* / *Who?*  
  - **Editing terms**: *uh, um, I mean, sorry, 那个* help manage trouble sources.

---

### 🧩 Common Ground & Audience Design
- **Common ground**: shared knowledge/beliefs within the conversation.  
- **Audience design**: speakers adapt **detail**, **word choice**, and **reference** (e.g., *the big blue mug* vs *that one*) to a partner’s needs and prior knowledge.  
- **Partner-specific** labels can form (e.g., “the **panda cup**”); later references become shorter once established.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 305–315 and underline one **implicature** example and one **indirect request**.  
2. **Context test (5 min)**: Write two sentences using **some**—one where **not all** is clearly implicated, and one where it is **canceled**.  
3. **Politeness rewrite**: Turn *Give me your notes* into two indirect, polite requests.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 🎭 Gricean Maxims Skits (12 min)
- **Groups of 3–4** write a 4-turn mini-dialogue **flouting** one maxim (clearly).  
- Perform; audience identifies **which maxim** and states the **implied meaning**.

### 2) 🔢 Scalar Cards (12 min)
- **Pairs** draw a **scale card** (e.g., ⟨all…some⟩).  
- One crafts a sentence with the **weaker** term; partner judges the **implicature** and tries to **cancel** it felicitously.

### 3) 🗣️ Indirect Speech-Act Clinic (10 min)
- Convert blunt requests into **two** polite versions; label the **illocutionary force** and **felicity conditions**.  
  - *Email me the slides tonight.* → *Could you…?* / *Would it be possible…?*

### 4) 🔁 Turn-Taking & Repair Roleplay (12 min)
- In triads, one **tells a short story**; listener provides **backchannels** and initiates **repair** at least twice.  
- Rotate roles; tally **editing terms** and **repair types**; discuss what felt natural in English vs Chinese.

### 5) 👥 Common-Ground Referencing Game (10 min)
- Pairs describe items in a small **grid** (colors/shapes). Establish a **label** (“the snowflake star”), then try shorter references.  
- Reflect: how quickly do partner-specific labels emerge?

### 6) Wrap (3 min)
- Write one **diagnostic cue** you’ll use to spot an **implicature** in reading/listening.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: For two dialogues, identify (a) maxim flouted, (b) inferred implicature, (c) whether it is **cancelable**, and (d) how **context** affects it.  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: When do you personally prefer **indirect** requests in English? Give one example and reasoning (politeness, face needs, hierarchy).

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 8, pp. 305–315): items on maxims, implicature, and speech acts.  
- **Short analysis (≈150–200 words)**: Record or recall a brief conversation (English or Chinese). Transcribe 6–8 turns; annotate **adjacency pairs**, **backchannels**, and **repair**. Point out any implicatures.

---

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** How does **implicature** differ from **entailment**?  
<!-- Implicatures are inference-based, context-dependent, and cancelable; entailments follow from sentence meaning and cannot be canceled without contradiction. -->
<!--
**Q2.** Name the four **Gricean Maxims** and give a one-phrase description.  -->
<!-- Quantity (informative), Quality (truthful/evidenced), Relation (relevant), Manner (clear/brief/orderly). -->
<!--
**Q3.** What is a **scalar implicature**? Give an example with **some**.  -->
<!-- Using a weaker scalar term (e.g., “some”) typically implicates that a stronger alternative (“all”) does not hold—unless context cancels it. -->
<!--
**Q4.** Give one reason to use an **indirect request** instead of a direct one.  -->
<!-- Politeness and face management, reducing imposition, maintaining social harmony or hierarchy. -->
<!--
**Q5.** What’s the preferred pattern in **repair** and why?  -->
<!-- Self-initiated self-repair is preferred: it is least disruptive and shows speaker responsibility for fixing trouble. -->

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore **language use in social contexts**, focusing on how meaning arises through interaction. Unlike monologues or isolated utterances, **dialogue** involves cooperation, shared knowledge, and continuous adjustment between interlocutors. We’ll cover foundational principles such as **Grice’s maxims**, as well as more dynamic notions like **common ground**, **audience design**, and **perspective-taking** in real-time conversation.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Gricean Maxims of Cooperative Communication

According to philosopher H.P. Grice, speakers follow four maxims when they aim to be cooperative:

1. **Quantity** – Be as informative as necessary; no more, no less.
2. **Quality** – Be truthful; do not say what you believe is false.
3. **Relation** – Be relevant.
4. **Manner** – Be clear; avoid ambiguity and obscurity.

> 🧠 Violations of these maxims often trigger **implicatures**—indirect meanings derived by listeners.

---

### Dialogue Is Interactive

- Dialogue is not just **taking turns** but **jointly constructing meaning**.
- Speakers and listeners **coordinate their actions**, **adjust timing**, and **anticipate responses**.
- The presence of **feedback** (e.g., head nods, “uh-huh”) plays a crucial role in this alignment.

---

### Common Ground

- **Common ground** = shared knowledge between speakers.
- Speakers tailor their messages based on **assumptions about what the listener knows**.
- This helps reduce ambiguity and processing load.

> Example:  
> “You know, the professor from last semester” presumes shared knowledge.

---

### Audience Design

- Speakers often adjust **length**, **detail**, and **clarity** depending on their audience.
- Related to **Theory of Mind**—our ability to model others’ mental states.
- Studies show that speakers consider their listener’s perspective, but **not always accurately or efficiently**.

---

### Egocentric vs. Listener-Oriented Production

- **Egocentric production**: Speakers sometimes overestimate the listener’s knowledge.
- **Listener-oriented production**: Adjustments based on assumptions about listener's needs.

> Real-life examples: Directions to a local vs. a tourist; inside jokes among friends.

---

### Comprehension and Perspective-Taking

- Listeners also work to **adopt the speaker’s viewpoint**.
- Successful comprehension requires **active inferencing** and **constant updating** of mental models.

---

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🗣️ Gricean Maxim Skits

- Students work in groups to create **short dialogues** where one speaker **violates a maxim**.
- Class guesses which maxim is violated and why.

### 🤝 Common Ground Game

- One student describes an object to another while **avoiding direct naming**.
- Pairs compare strategies and discuss what knowledge was assumed.

### 🔁 Audience Shift Exercise

- Students rewrite a short explanation (e.g., “How to play chess”) for:
  - a 6-year-old
  - a peer
  - a grandparent
- Class reflects on how the explanation changed and why.
