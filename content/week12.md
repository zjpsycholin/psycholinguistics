## 📘 Overview
Infants don’t get spaces between words. Yet by the end of the first year they already **recognize familiar words** and use multiple **cues** to carve continuous speech into candidates for words. This week we look at **prenatal learning**, **infant-directed speech (IDS/motherese)**, classic **infant methods** (HAS, HPP, CHT), **categorical perception & perceptual narrowing**, and how **statistical learning**, **prosody**, and **phonotactics** help solve the **segmentation problem**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 12, you should be able to:

- Describe **infant testing methods** (HAS, HPP, CHT) and what each reveals.
- Explain **categorical perception** and **perceptual narrowing** in the first year.
- Identify key properties of **IDS** and discuss how they may support attention and learning.
- Apply **statistical**, **prosodic**, and **phonotactic** cues to segment a speech stream.
- Compare segmentation cues in **English** and **Mandarin** and predict learner challenges.

---

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 9, pp. 325–344** — *Language Development* (infant perception, IDS, segmentation strategies).

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 👶 Prenatal & Newborn Learning
- Fetuses are sensitive to **prosodic patterns**; newborns prefer **mother’s voice** and **native-language rhythm**.
- Early preferences suggest **memory** for speech contours even before birth.

### 🧪 How We Measure Infant Perception
- **HAS (High-Amplitude Sucking)**: increased sucking when hearing something **novel**; used for **discrimination**.
- **HPP (Head-Turn Preference Procedure)**: infants turn toward the side playing stimuli they **prefer** (e.g., familiar vs novel).
- **CHT (Conditioned Head-Turn)**: train infants to turn head when a **phonetic category** changes (e.g., /ba/→/pa/); reveals **category boundaries**.

### 🎚️ Categorical Perception & Perceptual Narrowing
- Young infants discriminate **many** phonetic contrasts (even non-native); by ~10–12 months, sensitivity **narrows** toward **native** categories.
- Tuning is driven by **distributional** exposure (how often sounds appear near category boundaries).

### 🎶 Infant-Directed Speech (IDS / Motherese)
- Typical features: **higher pitch**, **exaggerated intonation**, **slower tempo**, **clearer vowels**, **shorter utterances**, more **repetition**.
- Functions: captures **attention**, highlights **phrase boundaries**, may enhance **category learning**; varies across languages/cultures.

### ✂️ The Segmentation Problem
- Continuous speech lacks consistent **word-boundary pauses**. Learners exploit **multiple cues**:
  - **Statistical learning**: lower **transitional probability** across word boundaries than within words.
  - **Prosodic cues**: **stress** patterns (e.g., English **trochaic** bias: STRONG-weak), **intonation** boundaries.
  - **Phonotactics**: language-specific constraints on **sound sequences** (e.g., where clusters can occur).
  - **Allophonic cues**: subtle sound variants signal **syllable** or **word** edges.
  - **Anchors**: own **name**, frequent **function words**, and familiar **frames** bootstrap segmentation.

### 🗺️ Cross-Linguistic Notes (EN ↔ ZH)
- **English**: stress-timed rhythm, many **consonant clusters**, strong **trochaic** tendency → stress cues are powerful.
- **Mandarin**: **tone** contrasts and relatively **syllable-timed** rhythm; less reliable **lexical stress** → learners rely more on **syllable**/tone and **statistics** than fixed stress.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 325–344 and note one example each of **statistics**, **prosody**, and **phonotactics** aiding segmentation.  
2. **Listen** to two short clips (to be provided): **ADS** vs **IDS**. List 3 acoustic differences.  
3. **Mini-stream**: Practice segmenting an artificial stream like *“bidakupadotigolabubidaku…”*. Mark your best guess at **word boundaries**.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 🎶 Motherese Analysis (12 min)
- In pairs, mark features in IDS vs ADS clips: **pitch range**, **tempo**, **vowel space**, **repetition**.
- Discuss: Which features would most help a **9-month-old** find words?

### 2) 🎵 Saffran-Style Segmentation Lab (18 min)
- Hear a 2-min **continuous** stream composed of 4 trisyllabic “words.”  
- Individually mark boundaries; then, as a class, compute **transitional probabilities** for two syllable pairs and see if your boundaries match the **actual words**.

### 3) 🔤 Strong-Syllable Hunt (10 min)
- English-like strings (e.g., **“MÁla bu** **GÓti pa** **DÁku…”**). Circle **strong** syllables; hypothesize **word onsets**.
- Compare to **Mandarin**: How would a tone language listener approach this without a strong **stress cue**?

### 4) 🔐 Phonotactics Puzzle (8 min)
- Given a mini **phonotactic table** (which onsets/codas are legal), decide where **boundaries** must fall in *“…ktobugla…”* vs *“…sto#bu…”* and justify.

### 5) 🧪 Methods Corner (10 min)
- Groups sketch a simple **HPP** or **CHT** experiment to test sensitivity to a non-native contrast (e.g., dental vs retroflex). Identify **stimuli**, **procedure**, **predictions**.

### 6) Wrap (2 min)
- On a sticky, write one **cue** you plan to rely on first when segmenting a noisy stream (and why).

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: For your artificial stream, list the cues you used (statistics/prosody/phonotactics), your **final segmentation**, and one **uncertainty**.  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: How might **Mandarin** vs **English** input shape early segmentation strategies?

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 9, pp. 325–344) on IDS and segmentation.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words)**: Design a minimal **HPP** study testing whether infants prefer **familiarized words** over part-words after exposure to an artificial language. Include **materials**, **procedure**, and **prediction**.  
- **Optional**: Record 30 seconds of your own **IDS** (in any language) reading a picture book; annotate where you **pause** and **exaggerate** pitch.

---

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** What does **HPP** measure and how is it different from **CHT**?  
<!-- HPP indexes listening preference (e.g., longer orientation to familiar/novel items) without conditioning; CHT conditions infants to turn at a category change to test discrimination with clear criteria. -->
<!--
**Q2.** Define **perceptual narrowing** and give a typical time window. --> 
<!-- Early broad sensitivity to many contrasts becomes tuned to native categories around 10–12 months as distributions are learned. -->
<!--
**Q3.** How do **transitional probabilities** signal word boundaries?  -->
<!-- Within-word syllable pairs have higher TPs than across-boundary pairs; low TP dips flag likely boundaries. -->
<!--
**Q4.** Why is **IDS** potentially helpful for segmentation?  -->
<!-- Higher pitch, exaggerated intonation, slower rate, and clearer vowels enhance attention and may highlight phrase/word boundaries. -->
<!--
**Q5.** Name one segmentation cue likely **stronger in English** than in **Mandarin**, and explain why.  -->
<!-- Lexical stress/prosodic stress: English’s trochaic bias provides a robust cue, whereas Mandarin lacks fixed lexical stress and relies more on tone and syllable timing. -->

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore how language acquisition begins **before birth** and progresses rapidly through **infancy**. We examine how infants perceive speech sounds, solve the segmentation problem, and begin learning their first words—all with **minimal explicit instruction**.

---

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🍼 Prenatal Language Learning

- Fetuses respond to external auditory stimuli (e.g., mother's voice, native language prosody).
- Evidence: **High-amplitude sucking (HAS)** shows preference for stories heard in utero.

---

### 🔍 Speech Perception and Phoneme Categorization

- Infants perceive **phonemic contrasts** not present in their native language (universal perceivers).
- With exposure, perception becomes **language-specific** by 10–12 months.
- Tools: **Habituation** and **head-turn paradigms**.

---

### 🧩 Solving the Segmentation Problem

- Speech is **continuous**; no silences mark word boundaries.
- Infants rely on:
  - **Prosodic cues** (stress patterns)
  - **Phonotactic probabilities**
  - **Statistical learning** (tracking transitional probabilities between syllables)

---

### 🧠 Infant-Directed Speech (IDS)

- Features: Higher pitch, exaggerated intonation, slower rate.
- Helps attract attention and **highlight linguistic structure**.

---

### 🧠 Early Word Learning

- Infants map sounds to meaning via:
  - **Associationist learning**
  - **Cross-situational learning**
  - **Social cues** (e.g., gaze, joint attention)
- **Mutual exclusivity** and **whole object assumption** guide inferences.

---
