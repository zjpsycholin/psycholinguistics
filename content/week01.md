## 📘 Overview
Welcome to *Introduction to Psycholinguistics*! This week, we begin by exploring what psycholinguistics is, what questions it asks, and how it connects to other fields. You’ll learn about what makes human language unique and how language relates to cognition, evolution, and communication.

We’ll also discuss myths about language, compare human and non-human communication systems, and learn how language may (or may not) shape the way we think.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:
- Define psycholinguistics and identify its major areas of study.
- Describe the six core design features of human language.
- Distinguish between descriptive and prescriptive grammar with examples.
- Discuss the continuity vs. discontinuity debate in language evolution.
- Evaluate whether animals can "use language" as humans do.

## ❗ Key Issues

### 1) What is Psycholinguistics?
Psycholinguistics studies **how language is processed and represented in the mind**—how we comprehend, produce, and acquire language. It draws on **linguistics (structure)**, **cognitive psychology (mental processes)**, **neuroscience (brain systems)**, and **philosophy (meaning & thought)**.  
**Guiding questions:** How do we understand and produce speech? How do children acquire language? What brain areas support language? Can animals learn language?

---

### 2) Hockett’s Design Features of Language
| Feature | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Semanticity** | Signals carry specific meanings | “Dog” / 狗 refers to a specific animal |
| **Arbitrariness** | No inherent link between form & meaning | “Dog” ≠ “gǒu” ≠ “perro” |
| **Discreteness** | Distinct units compose language | English /b/ vs /p/; Mandarin tones 妈/麻/马/骂 |
| **Displacement** | Talk about things not here/now | “I was in Paris last year” |
| **Duality of Patterning** | Meaningless sounds combine into meaningful words | /k/ + /æ/ + /t/ → “cat” |
| **Generativity** | Finite rules → infinite sentences | “The cat that chased the rat …” |

---

### 3) Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Grammar
- **Descriptive grammar**: What speakers actually say and understand in real life.
- **Prescriptive grammar**: Rules about what people *should* say in formal contexts.
- Why this matters: Psycholinguistics seeks to explain **mental grammar** and real usage, so descriptive patterns are crucial.

---

### 4) Can Animals Use Language?
Case studies:
- **Nim Chimpsky** (ASL-trained chimp): mostly **requests**, limited combinations.
- **Kanzi** (bonobo, lexigrams): understands many **spoken English** commands.
Takeaway: Impressive communication, but **limited syntax, recursion, and generativity** compared to humans.

---

### 5) Evolution of Language: Continuity vs. Discontinuity
- **Continuity**: Human language **evolved gradually** from simpler systems.
- **Discontinuity**: Language is a **qualitative leap**, uniquely human, requiring new cognitive/biological mechanisms.
Evidence includes ape communication, vocal tract/brain adaptations, and cultural emergence of grammar (e.g., creoles, sign languages).

---

## 🏠 Homework
- Re-read key sections (design features; grammar; apes).
- *Test Yourself* (Ch. 1): **Q1** (features), **Q2** (grammar), **Q4** (recursion), **Q6** (animal language).
- **Think About It (~150 words)**:  
  *Imagine a new primate species. What behaviors would convince you they have language?* Be specific about **syntax**, **recursion**, **displacement**, and **generativity**.

---

## 🧩 Mini-FAQ
- **Does onomatopoeia disprove arbitrariness?** Not really—forms differ across languages and aren’t systematic.
- **Is “wrong grammar” ungrammatical?** Not necessarily. Descriptive grammar captures what speakers **actually** do, including dialects.
- **If Pirahã lacks recursion, is recursion not universal?** The debate is ongoing; treat claims cautiously and look at broader evidence.

### 🔍 Hockett’s Design Features of Language
According to Charles Hockett, human language has **six key design features**:

| Feature               | Definition                                                   | Example                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Semanticity**       | Words and signals carry specific meanings                    | "Dog" means a specific kind of animal |
| **Arbitrariness**     | No natural link between form and meaning                     | "Dog" ≠ "gǒu" ≠ "perro"              |
| **Discreteness**      | Language consists of distinct, separable units               | /b/ vs. /p/                           |
| **Displacement**      | Talk about things not present in time/place                  | "I was in Paris last year"           |
| **Duality of Patterning** | Small units (phonemes) combine into meaningful units (words) | /k/ + /æ/ + /t/ = "cat"              |
| **Generativity**      | Finite rules create infinite sentences                       | “The cat that chased the rat…”       |

---

### 📚 Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Grammar

- **Descriptive grammar**: How people *actually* use language in daily life.
- **Prescriptive grammar**: Rules about how people *should* speak or write.
- Linguists focus on **descriptive grammar** to understand language as it is used in real-world contexts.

---

### 🐒 Can Animals Use Language?

We’ll look at famous case studies like:

- **Nim Chimpsky** (ASL-trained chimpanzee): Used signs mostly for requests.
- **Kanzi** (bonobo using lexigrams): Understood many spoken English words.

Despite some impressive skills, apes lack **syntax**, **recursion**, and **generativity**—hallmarks of human language.

---

### 🌱 Evolution of Language: Continuity vs. Discontinuity

- **Continuity Hypothesis**: Language evolved gradually from primate communication.
- **Discontinuity Hypothesis**: Language is a qualitatively unique system that appeared suddenly.

These hypotheses are tested through studies in comparative cognition, ape communication, and evolutionary biology.

## 🧠 Chapter 1 Lecture Notes: An Introduction to Language Science

Welcome to the first chapter of *Introduction to Psycholinguistics*! This chapter lays the foundation for how we understand language as a mental and cognitive system.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. What Is Psycholinguistics?

Psycholinguistics studies how language is **produced**, **comprehended**, **acquired**, and **represented** in the mind. It draws on fields like psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

> **Example**: When you hear the sentence “The cat sat on the mat,” your brain rapidly decodes sound, retrieves word meanings, and interprets sentence structure — all within seconds.

---

### 2. Hockett’s Design Features of Human Language

Charles Hockett (1960) proposed a set of features that define **human** language and distinguish it from animal communication:

* **Semanticity**: Signals convey meaning (e.g., “help” means someone needs assistance).
* **Arbitrariness**: No inherent link between signal and meaning (e.g., nothing about the word "dog" looks or sounds like an actual dog).
* **Discreteness**: Language is built from distinct units (e.g., phonemes).
* **Displacement**: Ability to talk about things not present (past, future, imaginary).
* **Duality of Patterning**: Sounds combine to form words, words combine into sentences.
* **Generativity**: Infinite sentences from finite rules and vocabulary.

> 🗂️ **Cross-linguistic Note**: All known human languages, including signed languages, share these design features.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll match these features to real examples from English and other languages you speak.

---

### 3. Grammar and the Mental Lexicon

* **Grammar**: The mental system of rules that governs how words combine into sentences.
* **Lexicon**: The mental store of words and their associated meanings, forms, and syntactic properties.

> **Example**: In English, “cat” is a noun, singular, and countable. This information is stored in your mental lexicon.

* **Descriptive Grammar**: Rules based on how language is actually used.
* **Prescriptive Grammar**: Rules taught as “proper usage” (e.g., never end a sentence with a preposition).

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: Descriptive linguistics shows that native speakers often break prescriptive rules while still communicating effectively.

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll examine “grammar rules” you’ve learned and test whether native speakers actually follow them.

---

### 4. Animal Communication vs. Human Language

* Apes like **Washoe**, **Kanzi**, and **Nim Chimpsky** have been taught sign or symbol systems.
* These systems can demonstrate **symbolic use**, but lack **recursion**, **generativity**, and consistent **displacement**.

> **Example**: Kanzi could use symbols to request objects, but did not form novel multi-clause utterances.

> 🔁 **Key Debate**: Is recursion (the ability to embed structures within structures) unique to humans? Some argue the **Pirahã language** lacks recursion, challenging claims of universality.

> 🎬 **In class**: We’ll watch a video of Kanzi using lexigrams and complete a comparison table of human vs. non-human communication.

---

### 5. Language and Thought

* **Linguistic Determinism**: Language determines thought. (Strong Whorfian view)
* **Linguistic Relativity**: Language influences perception and memory. (Weak Whorfian view)

> 🧪 **Empirical Evidence**:
>
> * **Color Perception**: Russian speakers distinguish light/dark blues faster than English speakers.
> * **Number Concepts**: Pirahã speakers struggle with quantities beyond 2–3 due to lack of number words.
> * **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Mandarin speakers may interpret counterfactuals differently than English speakers due to language structure.

> 🎨 **In class**: You’ll participate in a short version of the “Russian blues” task and reflect on your own language experience.

---

### 6. The Language Processing System (Preview)

* **Comprehension**: Mapping sounds to meaning — involves speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing.
* **Production**: Mapping meaning to speech — involves conceptual preparation, word retrieval, syntactic planning, articulation.
* **Modularity Debate**: Are these components independent modules, or do they interact dynamically?

> 🧩 **In class**: We’ll build a simple diagram of comprehension and production components as a preview of future chapters.
