## 📘 Overview
When you see or hear a word, recognition feels instant—but under the hood your brain is racing through **candidates**, using **frequency**, **spelling/sound similarity**, **morphology**, and **meaning** to settle on the best match. This week introduces the **mental lexicon** and shows how psychologists probe it with tasks like **lexical decision** and **priming**. You’ll run quick in-class demos to feel **frequency**, **neighborhood**, and **semantic/morphological priming** effects yourself, then connect your observations to classic **models of word recognition**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 5, you should be able to:

- Describe the **mental lexicon** and distinguish **lemma** (meaning/grammar) from **lexeme** (form/sound).
- Explain key effects in word recognition: **frequency**, **age of acquisition**, **neighborhood density**, and **morphological structure**.
- Define and exemplify **semantic**, **associative**, **form**, and **masked** **priming**.
- Run and interpret a simple **lexical decision** and **priming** demo (predict RT patterns; explain why).
- Compare core ideas of **recognition models** (Logogen/activation threshold, Cohort, Interactive Activation/IA; brief link to TRACE for speech).

## 📖 Required Reading

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🧠 Mental Lexicon: Structure & Access
- **Lemma vs. Lexeme**: a word’s **lemma** encodes semantics + syntactic category; its **lexeme** encodes **orthography/phonology** (letters/sounds, syllables, stress).
- **Organization** is **distributed**: words connect by **meaning** (cat–dog), **form** (cat–cap), and **morphology** (teach–teacher–teaches).

### ⏱️ Lexical Decision (Word vs. Nonword)
- Task: “Word?” → **YES/NO**.  
- **Word frequency**: high-frequency words (e.g., *people*) recognized **faster** than rare ones (e.g., *pergola*).  
- **Age of acquisition**: words learned earlier are generally faster.  
- **Pseudowords vs. illegal strings**: *blat* (looks word-like) slows decisions more than *xqmt*.

### 🧩 Neighborhood & Similarity
- **Orthographic/phonological neighborhood**: number of one-letter/one-phoneme “neighbors” (cat→cap/cot/can).  
- **Dense neighborhoods** can **hinder** lexical decision (competition) or sometimes **help** recognition in other tasks (more activation to settle).  
- **Big idea**: access involves **activation + competition** among similar candidates.

### 🌐 Priming: Speed from Relations
- **Semantic priming**: related primes (DOG→CAT) **speed** target recognition vs. unrelated (PEN→CAT).  
- **Associative priming**: learned associations (BREAD→BUTTER).  
- **Form/phonological priming**: overlap in letters/sounds (CORN→CORD) yields small, task-dependent effects.  
- **Morphological priming**: TEACH→TEACHER (or TEACHER→TEACH) facilitates beyond form overlap → evidence for **decomposition**.  
- **Masked priming**: very brief, masked primes can still speed related targets → **early, automatic** activation.

### 🧠 Models of Word Recognition (Spotlight)
- **Logogen / Threshold models**: each word has a **resting activation** (higher for frequent words); input raises activation until a **threshold** is reached.  
- **Cohort (spoken words)**: initial sounds activate a **cohort** of candidates (spa- → *spin, spot, space*), then **narrow** as input unfolds.  
- **Interactive Activation (IA, visual words)**: **features → letters → words** interact **bidirectionally**; explains word/letter effects and **top-down** influence.  
- **TRACE (spoken)**: an IA-style model for speech (features ↔ phonemes ↔ words) with **competition** and **context**.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 79–113 and note a real example of **semantic priming** you’ve felt in daily life.  
2. **Frequency check**: Pick 5 English words and guess their frequency (high/low); predict which are faster in lexical decision.  
3. **Mini network**: Draw a small **semantic network** for *school* (at least 8 nodes; label strongest links).

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) Lexical Decision Task Demo (12 min)
- Instructor flashes a list (mixed **high/low frequency**, **pseudowords**).  
- Students tap **YES**/**NO** on their phones (self-timed); write down 3 **slow** items.  
- **Debrief**: Were low-frequency and pseudowords slower? Any confusing pseudowords (*frind*)?

**Sample set (print or project):**  
`people, garden, nephew, pergola, axiom, fjord; frind, glabe, slint, xqmt`

### 2) Semantic Priming Mini-Experiment (15 min)
- Pairs: Partner A shows **prime→target** quickly (paper slips or slides). Partner B says target aloud and estimates speed (fast/slow).  
- **Sets**: Related (DOG→CAT; DOCTOR→NURSE), Unrelated (PEN→CAT), Morphological (TEACH→TEACHER), Form (CORN→CORD).  
- **Prediction**: Related & morphological **faster** than unrelated; form effects smaller/variable.

### 3) Neighborhood Challenge (10 min)
- For targets (*cat, bed, read, cake*), each group lists as many **one-letter neighbors** as possible in 2 minutes, then **predicts** which targets will be **slowest** in lexical decision (more neighbors ⇒ more competition).  
- Quick test with a short second list if time.

### 4) Morphology Puzzle (10 min)
- Identify **stems** and **affixes** in items like *teacher, happiness, unreadable, miscalculate*.  
- Decide which prime–target pairs should show **morphological priming** beyond form (e.g., HAPPY→HAPPINESS vs. CORN→CORNER).

### 5) Models Quick-Stations (10 min)
- Small groups rotate through **three posters**: Logogen, Cohort/TRACE (spoken), Interactive Activation (visual).  
- For each model, write **one strength**, **one limitation**, and **one prediction** about: frequency, neighborhood, or priming.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **Summarize your results** from Activities 1–2 in 5–7 bullet points (which conditions were fastest/slowest and why).  
- **Reflection (100–120 words):** Which model best fits your observations today? Give one concrete example.  
- **Optional**: Re-run a tiny priming test with friends/family (3 related vs 3 unrelated pairs) and compare impressions.

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 3, pp. 79–113): items on lexical decision, priming, morphology.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words):** Explain a **semantic vs. morphological** priming contrast you observed (or expected). What does it imply about **decomposition**?  
- **Extension (optional):** Build a 10-node **semantic network** for a new word (e.g., *travel*); label link strengths.

## 📘 Overview

How does your brain know that the word “bank” can mean both a place for money and the side of a river? This week we’ll explore **how words are linked to meanings**, how the mind resolves ambiguous words, and what this reveals about the organization of the mental lexicon. We’ll also learn how semantic networks connect concepts and how brain evidence supports these models.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Explain how **word meanings** are stored and accessed in the brain.
- Describe how the brain resolves **ambiguity** in word meaning.
- Understand and illustrate **semantic networks** and spreading activation.
- Discuss experimental evidence for semantic priming and network structure.
- Connect behavioral data and brain studies to models of meaning.

---

## 📖 Required Reading

- **Chapter 3 (pp. 113–129)** from *Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science* by Matthew Traxler.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🗝️ Lexical Ambiguity

- **Lexical ambiguity**: Many words have multiple meanings (“bat”—an animal or a piece of sports equipment).
- **How is ambiguity resolved?**
  - **Context** is crucial. The brain uses sentence or situation cues to select the intended meaning.
  - **Time course**: Both meanings may be briefly activated before context narrows down the choice.

---

### 🔗 Semantic Networks

- **Semantic networks**: Concepts are stored as nodes connected by links representing relationships (e.g., *dog* is linked to *cat*, *pet*, *bark*).
- **Spreading activation**: Activating one concept (e.g., “nurse”) automatically spreads to related nodes (e.g., “doctor”).
- **Support**: Evidence from **semantic priming** and reaction time experiments shows that related words are accessed faster.

---

### 🧪 Experimental Findings

- **Semantic priming**: Recognizing a word (e.g., “bread”) is faster when it follows a related word (e.g., “butter”).
- **Ambiguity resolution studies**:
  - Eye-tracking and reaction times reveal both meanings of ambiguous words are initially activated.
  - Brain imaging (fMRI, ERP) shows different neural patterns for ambiguity and meaning selection.

---

### 🧬 Word Meaning in the Brain

- **Brain regions**: Areas in the temporal and frontal lobes are critical for processing meaning.
- **Neuropsychology**: Some brain injuries cause **semantic deficits** (e.g., difficulty naming or understanding related concepts).

## 🔜 Looking Ahead

Next week, we’ll look at how your mind builds meaning **beyond individual words**—exploring how sentences are parsed and interpreted in real time!

---





<!--
## 📘 Overview

In this session, we move beyond lexical access and focus on how the brain **represents**, **interprets**, and **resolves** word meanings. You’ll learn how context and experience shape the comprehension of ambiguous or polysemous words, and how neuroscientific methods help uncover the distributed nature of meaning representation in the brain.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Lexical Ambiguity

- Words can have:
  - **Homonyms**: two unrelated meanings (e.g., *bank*)
  - **Polysemes**: related meanings (e.g., *paper* as material or article)
- Ambiguity must be resolved quickly and often unconsciously during comprehension:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### Context Effects

- **Contextual cues** help the brain suppress irrelevant meanings.
- Example: “The fisherman sat on the river bank.” → *bank* = riverbank
- **Priming** experiments show faster responses when contextually appropriate meanings are activated.

---

### Semantic Priming

- When a word like “doctor” is processed faster after seeing “nurse” than “bread”.
- Priming reveals the **organization** of semantic memory: related meanings are **closely connected** in the mental lexicon:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Representation of Word Meaning

| Theory | Key Idea |
|--------|----------|
| **Semantic Feature Theory** | Words are represented by sets of semantic features (e.g., +ANIMATE, +TOOL) |
| **Prototype Theory** | Meaning is organized around a prototypical example |
| **Distributed Semantic Representations** | Meaning is spread over networks of shared features |

---

### Embodied & Distributed Views (Revisited)

- Meaning is **not localized** to one area; it is **distributed** across sensory, motor, and associative regions.
- E.g., reading “kick” activates **motor areas** in the leg-related cortex:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- Supported by fMRI studies and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) experiments.

## 🧠 Chapter 5 Lecture Notes: Word Recognition and Lexical Access I

How do we recognize words so rapidly and accurately — even in noisy environments or unfamiliar voices? This chapter explores how listeners perceive speech and how the brain retrieves word meaning from the mental lexicon.

---

## 📘 Core Topics & Concepts

### 1. The Challenge of Speech Perception

* **Speech signal**: rapid, continuous, and variable across speakers and contexts
* **Coarticulation**: speech sounds overlap, yet we still identify discrete words
* **Lack of invariance**: no single acoustic cue always corresponds to a specific phoneme

> 🧠 Despite variability, humans are highly efficient speech processors

> 🎧 **In class**: We’ll hear examples of ambiguous or coarticulated speech and identify what makes them hard to parse.

---

### 2. Segmentation and Word Boundaries

* No clear boundaries between spoken words in fluent speech
* **Segmentation cues**:

  * **Stress patterns** (e.g., English uses trochaic stress: “MOther,” “BAby”)
  * **Phonotactic probabilities**: likelihood of certain sound sequences (e.g., /ng/ never starts a word in English)
  * **Statistical learning**: tracking transitional probabilities between syllables (e.g., “pre-tty-ba-by”)

> 🔍 **Research Spotlight**: Infants as young as 8 months use statistical learning to identify word boundaries in a speech stream

> 🧪 **In class**: We’ll try a brief segmentation demo using an artificial language stream.

---

### 3. The Mental Lexicon

#### Structure of the Lexicon

* **Lexical entries**: include word meaning, phonological form, syntactic category, morphological information
* Organized by:

  * **Frequency**: high-frequency words are recognized faster
  * **Neighborhood density**: number of similar-sounding words
  * **Semantic networks**: related meanings are linked

#### Accessing the Lexicon

* **Lexical access**: retrieving a word’s information during comprehension
* Influenced by bottom-up (sound) and top-down (contextual) cues

> 🔁 **Example**: In “He buttered the…” → likely access “toast” before “window” based on context

> 🧠 **In class**: We’ll map how word frequency and neighborhood density affect recognition.

---

### 4. Models of Spoken Word Recognition

* **Cohort Model**:

  * Word recognition starts from initial sounds (cohort)
  * Candidates are narrowed as more information comes in
* **TRACE Model**:

  * Interactive activation model
  * Includes competition between word candidates and top-down feedback

> 🎯 Both models explain different aspects of real-time word recognition

> 📊 **In class**: We’ll compare how the same input would be processed in the Cohort vs. TRACE model

| Concept              | Description                           | Example                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Coarticulation       | Overlapping speech sounds             | "don’t you" → "doncha"                  |
| Statistical Learning | Using probabilities to segment speech | "pretty baby" → likely break after “ty” |
| Lexical Frequency    | Common words accessed faster          | “the,” “cat,” “go”                      |
| Cohort Model         | Early activation of word candidates   | “ba…” → “baby,” “bacon,” “badge”        |
| TRACE Model          | Dynamic, interactive processing       | Competing and reinforcing candidates    |
