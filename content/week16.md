<!--
## 📘 Overview
Aphasia is a **language** disorder caused by **brain damage** (typically stroke), affecting **speaking, understanding, reading,** and/or **writing**. In this week, we use classic syndromes—**Broca’s**, **Wernicke’s**, and **conduction aphasia**—to ask: *How is language organized in the brain?* We examine the traditional **Wernicke–Lichtheim–Geschwind (WLG)** model and why strict one-area→one-syndrome mappings often **break down**. You’ll analyze real **case profiles**, practice **lesion mapping**, and experience tasks that reveal **agrammatic comprehension**, **repetition failures**, and **naming deficits**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 16, you should be able to:

- Describe hallmark symptoms of **Broca’s**, **Wernicke’s**, and **conduction** aphasia (fluency, comprehension, repetition, naming).
- Explain the classical **WLG model** (Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, arcuate fasciculus) and identify its **predictive limits**.
- Interpret why **lesion–symptom relationships** are often **distributed** rather than perfectly localized.
- Diagnose simplified **case vignettes** and justify your decisions with **behavioral evidence**.
- Predict comprehension difficulty for **syntactically complex** sentences in **agrammatism**.
- Outline basic principles of **assessment** and **rehabilitation** (focus, intensity, compensation vs restitution).

---

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 13, pp. 485–501** — *Aphasia* (overview; classic syndromes; lesion–symptom logic; introductory assessment examples).

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🧭 Classical Syndromes (behavioral signatures)
- **Broca’s aphasia (nonfluent/agrammatic)**: **Effortful**, short utterances; reduced **function words**/**inflections** (“telegraphic speech”); **relatively better comprehension** for simple sentences; **poor repetition**; **naming** impaired.
- **Wernicke’s aphasia (fluent/logorrheic)**: **Fluent but empty** speech; **semantic paraphasias** (saying *fork* for *spoon*), **neologisms**; **poor comprehension**; **poor repetition**; **naming** impaired.
- **Conduction aphasia**: **Fluent** output and **good comprehension**, but **markedly poor repetition**, especially for **novel** or **long** sequences; frequent **phonemic paraphasias** and **self-corrections**.

### 🧱 WLG Model (and why it’s not the whole story)
- **WLG** posits: Wernicke’s (word meaning/lexicon) ↔ **arcuate fasciculus** ↔ Broca’s (speech planning/syntax).  
- **Limitations**: Real strokes often affect **multiple** regions/white-matter tracts; similar symptoms can arise from **different** lesions; some “Broca’s” symptoms can occur **outside** Broca’s gyrus (and vice versa). Modern views emphasize **distributed networks**.

### 🧪 Naming, Repetition, Comprehension
- **Naming** taps lexical retrieval and phonological encoding; frequency and semantic cues modulate success.  
- **Repetition** stresses **phonological loop** + **arcuate fasciculus** integrity; conduction aphasia shows **repetition-specific** breakdown.  
- **Comprehension** can fail selectively for **syntactic movement/complexity** (e.g., **object relatives**, **passives**) in **agrammatism**.

### 🧩 Agrammatic Comprehension (Broca’s profile)
- Disproportionate difficulty with **non-canonical** word orders:  
  - *“The boy that the girl pushed was tall.”* (object-relative)  
  - *“The boy was pushed by the girl.”* (passive)  
- Performance improves when **semantic**/world knowledge can rescue the parse.

### 🧬 Lesion–Symptom Mapping (intro)
- Beyond single areas: symptoms often reflect **network disconnection** (gray + **white matter**).  
- **VLSM** (voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping) aggregates many patients to identify **regions** where damage **predicts** a deficit better than chance.

### 🔁 Recovery & Rehabilitation (preview)
- Recovery depends on **lesion size/site**, time post-onset, and **therapy intensity**; approaches include **impairment-focused** (e.g., phonological/semantic drills) and **communication-focused** (compensatory strategies). Some therapies leverage **prosody** and **melody** to scaffold speech output.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 485–501; list **three** behavioral markers that distinguish **Broca** vs **Wernicke** aphasia.  
2. Watch a short aphasia interview (link in LMS) and note **fluency**, **content**, **comprehension**, **repetition**.  
3. **Sentence probe**: Predict which sentences (active vs passive vs object-relative) will challenge an **agrammatic** patient—and **why**.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 📺 Case Vignette Spotlights (12 min)
- Listen to short audio/video clips (transcripts provided).  
- In pairs, classify each case (Broca/Wernicke/conduction) and **underline** evidence (fluency, comprehension, repetition, naming).

### 2) 🗺️ Lesion Mapping Puzzle (15 min)
- You receive simplified **MRI silhouettes** with highlighted regions (peri-Sylvian areas, arcuate tract sketch).  
- Match each case to the **most plausible** lesion **pattern**; explain mismatches where behavior and simple localization **diverge**.

### 3) 🔁 Repetition vs Paraphrase (10 min)
- Try to repeat increasing-length sentences; then paraphrase **meaning** only.  
- Discuss why **conduction aphasia** preserves gist but loses **verbatim** form.

### 4) 🧩 Agrammatic Comprehension Lab (10 min)
- **Sentence–picture** matching: actives, passives, object-relatives.  
- Predict error patterns for agrammatic profiles; relate to **syntactic movement** and **working memory**.

### 5) 🧪 Naming Microlab (8 min)
- **High vs low-frequency** pictures with **semantic cueing** (category) or **phonemic cueing** (first sound).  
- Compare facilitation patterns; what does each cue tell us about the **locus** of difficulty?

### 6) Wrap (5 min)
- Exit slip: Name **one** behavior that best distinguishes **conduction** from **Wernicke** aphasia, and **why**.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: For one vignette, write a **defensible diagnosis** and a short **lesion hypothesis** (region/tract).  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: Which comprehension test best reveals **agrammatism**, and what alternative explanation must you **rule out**?

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 13, pp. 485–501) items on classic syndromes and repetition/naming patterns.  
- **Short write-up (≈150–200 words)**: Propose a **mini assessment battery** (3–4 tasks) to differentiate **Broca**, **Wernicke**, and **conduction** aphasia in 10 minutes; justify each task.

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** What behavioral triad distinguishes **Broca’s** from **Wernicke’s** aphasia?  
<!-- Broca: nonfluent/effortful speech, relatively better simple comprehension, poor repetition; Wernicke: fluent but empty speech, poor comprehension, poor repetition. -->
<!--
**Q2.** What is the **hallmark** of **conduction aphasia**?  
<!-- Disproportionately impaired repetition with relatively preserved comprehension and fluent output, plus frequent phonemic paraphasias/self-corrections. -->
<!--
**Q3.** Why does a **strict WLG** mapping often fail to predict symptoms perfectly?  
<!-- Real lesions disrupt networks (gray + white matter); similar behaviors can arise from different lesion patterns; functional reorganization/variability across individuals. -->
<!--
**Q4.** Which sentence types typically challenge **agrammatic** comprehension, and why?  
<!-- Non-canonical structures involving movement (passives, object-relatives) because they require hierarchical dependencies beyond linear order. -->
<!--
**Q5.** How can **cueing** help diagnose **naming** deficits?  
<!-- Phonemic cues suggest phonological retrieval problems; semantic cues suggest access to meaning is fragile but can be boosted. -->
