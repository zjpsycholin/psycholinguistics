## üéØ Overview

As we approach the end of the course, this week offers time to reflect on what you've learned, how your thinking has evolved, and how psycholinguistics connects with your academic and personal interests. We‚Äôll also discuss big-picture questions, review course themes, and gather your feedback to improve future iterations of this course.

---

## üìò Core Activities

- Course-wide **wrap-up discussion**
- Submit your **final project write-up** (if assigned)
- Optional **personal reflection** or learning journal
- Participate in an **anonymous course feedback survey**

---

## üß† Recap and Integration

We'll revisit key ideas and ask:

- What were the most surprising or memorable insights from the course?
- How did your understanding of language and mind change?
- Which topics would you like to explore more deeply in the future?
- How do psycholinguistic principles apply to real-world communication?

---

## üìù Final Project Write-Up (if applicable)

If your group or individual project includes a final written component, it is due this week.

**Guidelines (unless otherwise noted by instructor):**

- 800‚Äì1,500 words (flexible depending on format)
- Include:
 - Title
 - Research question/topic
 - Background and rationale
 - Method, analysis, or argument
 - Key findings or reflections
 - References (if used)

Submit via [platform or method specified by instructor].

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Optional: Personal Reflection

You are encouraged (but not required) to write a brief reflection on your learning this semester.

Prompts may include:
- What challenged you most in this course?
- What are you most proud of?
- Has this course changed how you think about language or mind?
- What would you say to a future student considering this course?

## üìã Anonymous Course Feedback

Please take 5‚Äì10 minutes to fill out the anonymous course feedback form.

Your responses are **confidential** and help improve future versions of this course.

## üéâ Congratulations!

You‚Äôve reached the end of *Introduction to Psycholinguistics*. Whether you‚Äôre continuing in linguistics, psychology, education, or another field, we hope this course has helped you see language as a rich and fascinating window into the human mind.

&lt;h2 id="-course-introduction">üß† Course Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psycholinguistics&lt;/strong> is the scientific study of how humans acquire, produce, understand, and represent language in the mind. This course introduces foundational theories, research methods, and key findings in the field, offering an integrated view of linguistic knowledge, language development, processing mechanisms, and neural underpinnings. Topics include speech perception, word recognition, sentence parsing, discourse comprehension, bilingualism, non-literal language, and sign language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week 10: üí¨ Pragmatics and Dialogue I</title><link>https://zjpsycholin.github.io/psycholinguistics/week10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zjpsycholin.github.io/psycholinguistics/week10/</guid><description>How conversation works: Grice‚Äôs maxims and implicature, scalar terms, speech acts, turn-taking, adjacency pairs, repair, and common ground.
