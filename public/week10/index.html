## 📘 Overview
Everyday conversation seems effortless, but it relies on powerful **pragmatic principles** and **interactive routines**. This week introduces **Grice’s Cooperative Principle and maxims**, **conversational implicature** (including **scalar implicatures**), **speech acts** (direct vs indirect), and core structures of dialogue: **turn-taking**, **adjacency pairs**, and **repair**. We’ll also touch on **common ground** and **audience design**—how speakers tailor messages for specific listeners.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of Week 10, you should be able to:

- State **Grice’s Cooperative Principle** and the four **Maxims**; diagnose **violations** vs **floutings** and infer the likely **implicature**.
- Explain **conversational implicature** vs **entailment** and why implicatures are **cancelable**.
- Define **scalar implicature** (e.g., *some → not all*) and show how **context** strengthens or cancels it.
- Identify **speech acts** (locutionary/illocutionary/perlocutionary) and rewrite **direct** as **indirect** requests politely.
- Recognize **turn-taking cues**, **adjacency pairs**, and common **repair** formats in dialogue.
- Describe **common ground**/**audience design** and give one partner-specific adaptation example.

---

## 📖 Required Reading
- **Traxler (1st ed.), Chapter 8, pp. 305–315** — *Dialogue* (selected sections on pragmatics and conversation structure).

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Mini-Explanations

### 🤝 Cooperative Principle & Gricean Maxims
- **Cooperative Principle**: “Make your contribution such as is required… by the accepted purpose of the talk exchange.”
- **Maxims**  
  - **Quantity**: Be as informative as needed, no more or less.  
  - **Quality**: Do not say what you believe to be false; don’t assert without evidence.  
  - **Relation** (*Relevance*): Be relevant.  
  - **Manner**: Be clear, brief, orderly; avoid ambiguity.
- **Flouting** (overtly breaking a maxim) often **signals an implicature** (e.g., irony, understatement).

**Example**  
A: *How was the exam?*  
B: *Well, the room was very comfortable.* → Flouts **Relation**; implicates “it didn’t go well.”

---

### 🕵️ Conversational Implicature
- **Implicature**: meaning inferred from **maxim-guided reasoning**, not explicitly stated.  
- **Cancelability**: “Some students passed—**in fact, all did**.” (implicature *not all* is canceled)  
- **Entailment vs Implicature**: Entailments follow from **truth conditions** and **cannot** be canceled without contradiction.

---

### 📏 Scalar Implicature
- **Scales**: ⟨all, most, many, some⟩; ⟨always, often, sometimes⟩; ⟨must, should, may⟩.  
- Saying a **weaker** term (e.g., *some*) implicates the stronger is **not** satisfied (*not all*), **unless** context cancels it.  
- **Strengtheners**: numerals, explicit upper bounds, contrastive stress, corrective follow-ups.

**Mini-contrast**  
- *Some of the files uploaded successfully* → typically implicates *not all*.  
- *At least some of the files uploaded* → weaker commitment; implicature softened.

---

### 🎭 Speech Acts (Direct vs Indirect)
- **Locutionary** (literal form), **Illocutionary** (intended act: request, offer), **Perlocutionary** (effect on listener).  
- **Direct**: *Close the window.*  
- **Indirect**: *Could you close the window?* / *It’s a bit cold in here.* (relies on shared norms and politeness).  
- **Felicity conditions**: speaker’s authority/ability, appropriateness, sincerity.

---

### 🔁 Turn-Taking, Adjacency Pairs, and Repair
- **Turn-taking**: listeners use **TRPs** (intonation, syntax completion, gaze) to enter; **backchannels** (*uh-huh,嗯*) signal attention.  
- **Adjacency pairs**: **Q–A**, **Greeting–Greeting**, **Offer–Acceptance/Refusal**; “preferred” responses (e.g., acceptance) are quicker and simpler than dispreferred (refusals → delays, hedges).  
- **Repair**:  
  - **Self-initiated self-repair**: *I went to Bei— I mean, **Beijing**.*  
  - **Other-initiated repair**: *Sorry?* / *Who?*  
  - **Editing terms**: *uh, um, I mean, sorry, 那个* help manage trouble sources.

---

### 🧩 Common Ground & Audience Design
- **Common ground**: shared knowledge/beliefs within the conversation.  
- **Audience design**: speakers adapt **detail**, **word choice**, and **reference** (e.g., *the big blue mug* vs *that one*) to a partner’s needs and prior knowledge.  
- **Partner-specific** labels can form (e.g., “the **panda cup**”); later references become shorter once established.

---

## 📝 Pre-Class Activities
1. **Read** pp. 305–315 and underline one **implicature** example and one **indirect request**.  
2. **Context test (5 min)**: Write two sentences using **some**—one where **not all** is clearly implicated, and one where it is **canceled**.  
3. **Politeness rewrite**: Turn *Give me your notes* into two indirect, polite requests.

---

## 💬 In-Class Activities

### 1) 🎭 Gricean Maxims Skits (12 min)
- **Groups of 3–4** write a 4-turn mini-dialogue **flouting** one maxim (clearly).  
- Perform; audience identifies **which maxim** and states the **implied meaning**.

### 2) 🔢 Scalar Cards (12 min)
- **Pairs** draw a **scale card** (e.g., ⟨all…some⟩).  
- One crafts a sentence with the **weaker** term; partner judges the **implicature** and tries to **cancel** it felicitously.

### 3) 🗣️ Indirect Speech-Act Clinic (10 min)
- Convert blunt requests into **two** polite versions; label the **illocutionary force** and **felicity conditions**.  
  - *Email me the slides tonight.* → *Could you…?* / *Would it be possible…?*

### 4) 🔁 Turn-Taking & Repair Roleplay (12 min)
- In triads, one **tells a short story**; listener provides **backchannels** and initiates **repair** at least twice.  
- Rotate roles; tally **editing terms** and **repair types**; discuss what felt natural in English vs Chinese.

### 5) 👥 Common-Ground Referencing Game (10 min)
- Pairs describe items in a small **grid** (colors/shapes). Establish a **label** (“the snowflake star”), then try shorter references.  
- Reflect: how quickly do partner-specific labels emerge?

### 6) Wrap (3 min)
- Write one **diagnostic cue** you’ll use to spot an **implicature** in reading/listening.

---

## 🔁 Post-Class Review
- **One-pager**: For two dialogues, identify (a) maxim flouted, (b) inferred implicature, (c) whether it is **cancelable**, and (d) how **context** affects it.  
- **Reflection (100–120 words)**: When do you personally prefer **indirect** requests in English? Give one example and reasoning (politeness, face needs, hierarchy).

---

## 🏠 Homework
- **Textbook “Test Yourself”** (Ch. 8, pp. 305–315): items on maxims, implicature, and speech acts.  
- **Short analysis (≈150–200 words)**: Record or recall a brief conversation (English or Chinese). Transcribe 6–8 turns; annotate **adjacency pairs**, **backchannels**, and **repair**. Point out any implicatures.

---

## 🧩 Self-Check Questions

**Q1.** How does **implicature** differ from **entailment**?  
<!-- Implicatures are inference-based, context-dependent, and cancelable; entailments follow from sentence meaning and cannot be canceled without contradiction. -->
<!--
**Q2.** Name the four **Gricean Maxims** and give a one-phrase description.  -->
<!-- Quantity (informative), Quality (truthful/evidenced), Relation (relevant), Manner (clear/brief/orderly). -->
<!--
**Q3.** What is a **scalar implicature**? Give an example with **some**.  -->
<!-- Using a weaker scalar term (e.g., “some”) typically implicates that a stronger alternative (“all”) does not hold—unless context cancels it. -->
<!--
**Q4.** Give one reason to use an **indirect request** instead of a direct one.  -->
<!-- Politeness and face management, reducing imposition, maintaining social harmony or hierarchy. -->
<!--
**Q5.** What’s the preferred pattern in **repair** and why?  -->
<!-- Self-initiated self-repair is preferred: it is least disruptive and shows speaker responsibility for fixing trouble. -->

## 📘 Overview

This week we explore **language use in social contexts**, focusing on how meaning arises through interaction. Unlike monologues or isolated utterances, **dialogue** involves cooperation, shared knowledge, and continuous adjustment between interlocutors. We’ll cover foundational principles such as **Grice’s maxims**, as well as more dynamic notions like **common ground**, **audience design**, and **perspective-taking** in real-time conversation.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Gricean Maxims of Cooperative Communication

According to philosopher H.P. Grice, speakers follow four maxims when they aim to be cooperative:

1. **Quantity** – Be as informative as necessary; no more, no less.
2. **Quality** – Be truthful; do not say what you believe is false.
3. **Relation** – Be relevant.
4. **Manner** – Be clear; avoid ambiguity and obscurity.

> 🧠 Violations of these maxims often trigger **implicatures**—indirect meanings derived by listeners.

---

### Dialogue Is Interactive

- Dialogue is not just **taking turns** but **jointly constructing meaning**.
- Speakers and listeners **coordinate their actions**, **adjust timing**, and **anticipate responses**.
- The presence of **feedback** (e.g., head nods, “uh-huh”) plays a crucial role in this alignment.

---

### Common Ground

- **Common ground** = shared knowledge between speakers.
- Speakers tailor their messages based on **assumptions about what the listener knows**.
- This helps reduce ambiguity and processing load.

> Example:  
> “You know, the professor from last semester” presumes shared knowledge.

---

### Audience Design

- Speakers often adjust **length**, **detail**, and **clarity** depending on their audience.
- Related to **Theory of Mind**—our ability to model others’ mental states.
- Studies show that speakers consider their listener’s perspective, but **not always accurately or efficiently**.

---

### Egocentric vs. Listener-Oriented Production

- **Egocentric production**: Speakers sometimes overestimate the listener’s knowledge.
- **Listener-oriented production**: Adjustments based on assumptions about listener's needs.

> Real-life examples: Directions to a local vs. a tourist; inside jokes among friends.

---

### Comprehension and Perspective-Taking

- Listeners also work to **adopt the speaker’s viewpoint**.
- Successful comprehension requires **active inferencing** and **constant updating** of mental models.

---

## 📚 Reading

- Traxler (2012), Chapter 8: *Dialogue* (pp. 305–321)

---

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pragmatics** | The study of how meaning is conveyed in context |
| **Gricean Maxims** | Principles speakers follow for cooperative communication |
| **Common Ground** | Shared knowledge and assumptions in conversation |
| **Audience Design** | Adjusting speech based on listener’s needs |
| **Egocentric Production** | When speakers fail to account for listener’s perspective |

---

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🗣️ Gricean Maxim Skits

- Students work in groups to create **short dialogues** where one speaker **violates a maxim**.
- Class guesses which maxim is violated and why.

### 🤝 Common Ground Game

- One student describes an object to another while **avoiding direct naming**.
- Pairs compare strategies and discuss what knowledge was assumed.

### 🔁 Audience Shift Exercise

- Students rewrite a short explanation (e.g., “How to play chess”) for:
  - a 6-year-old
  - a peer
  - a grandparent
- Class reflects on how the explanation changed and why.

---

## ❓ Self-Check Questions

1. What are the four Gricean maxims, and how do they contribute to effective communication?
2. How does common ground influence what we say and how we interpret what others say?
3. What is audience design, and how is it related to Theory of Mind?
4. What evidence shows that dialogue is a cooperative, interactive process?

---

## 🧩 Practice Prompt

> Dialogue:  
> A: “Where’s the salad dressing?”  
> B: “There’s a gas station around the corner.”  
>
> - What maxim is being violated here?
> - What implicature might be inferred?
