  <meta property="og:description" content="👋 Welcome to Second Language Acquisition (Undergraduate) You’ll learn how additional languages are acquired—and how that knowledge can make you a sharper learner, teacher, and communicator. We’ll connect linguistic, psychological, and social perspectives to real EFL contexts in China.
What we’ll explore Foundations: What it means to know a language; L1–L2 differences; input, interaction, and development. Linguistics of SLA: Interlanguage, developmental sequences, and explanations for learner patterns. Psychology &amp; Social context: Attention, memory, motivation, identity, and classroom interaction. From knowledge to use: Fluency, pragmatics, and designing tasks that actually help. How we’ll learn Short mini-lectures &#43; guided discussion Hands-on analysis of real learner data Micro-teaching, task design, and peer feedback A small group project (poster &#43; 5-min talk in Week 12) Quick facts (from the syllabus) Meetings: 12 weeks · 3 sessions/week · 45 minutes each Audience: English majors (no prior SLA background needed) Textbook: Saville-Troike, Introducing SLA (3rd ed.) Assessments snapshot: Reading checks · Concept cards · Observation logs · Final poster talk/project Why this matters (what you’ll take away) Clear explanations of key SLA concepts (input, transfer, motivation, aptitude). Confidence reading basic research and testing predictions in class. Practical tools for feedback, task design, and fluency building. A sharper eye for patterns in Chinese ↔ English learning. How to succeed Prepare lightly but regularly (short readings &#43; quick checks). Engage in activities—the labs and micro-teaching are where ideas “click.” Use examples from your world (tutoring, media, social apps, exams). Work with your group—share data, divide tasks, rehearse the poster talk. If you’re curious about the full plan, see the Syllabus page and the Week pages for topic-by-topic notes.">
