## 📘 Overview

This week, we explore how people process language that **doesn’t mean exactly what it says**, including metaphors, idioms, and metonymy. We’ll review theoretical models, evidence from behavioral and neuroscience studies, and the role of **context** and **embodied cognition** in interpreting figurative expressions.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Types of Nonliteral Language

- **Metaphor**: "My lawyer is a shark."
- **Metonymy**: "The White House issued a statement."
- **Idioms**: "Kick the bucket", "Spill the beans"
- **Underspecified expressions**: Ambiguity invites inferencing.

---

### The Standard Pragmatic View

- **Literal meaning first**, then **nonliteral reinterpretation** if needed.
- Comprehension involves:
  1. Accessing literal meaning
  2. Detecting anomaly or inconsistency
  3. Reanalyzing to arrive at nonliteral interpretation
- Challenge: Empirical evidence shows **figurative meaning can be accessed directly** in context:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

---

### The Career of Metaphor Hypothesis

- Metaphors evolve with familiarity:
  - **Novel metaphors** require comparison and mapping.
  - **Conventional metaphors** are processed more like **categorical statements**.
- E.g., "The mind is a computer" (novel) → "He’s burning the candle at both ends" (conventional):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

---

### Embodied Cognition and Metaphor

- Understanding metaphors may involve **sensorimotor systems**.
- "Grasping the idea" may activate **grasping-related motor areas** in the brain.
- Suggests **semantic processing is grounded in perception and action** systems.

---

### Idioms and Frozen Metaphors

- Idioms have **fixed forms and meanings**, often processed as **chunks**.
- Processing depends on:
  - **Transparency** (How easily literal meaning suggests figurative meaning)
  - **Familiarity**
- Can be stored **lexically** or **constructed compositionally** depending on usage.

---

### Neural Basis of Figurative Language

- fMRI and ERP studies show:
  - **Right hemisphere** more involved in novel metaphor and joke processing.
  - **Left hemisphere** handles conventionalized expressions.
- Brain areas involved: **Inferior frontal gyrus**, **posterior temporal lobe**, **motor cortex** (for embodied metaphors):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 📚 Reading

- Traxler (2012), Chapter 7: *Nonliteral Language Processing* (pp. 267–297)

---

## 🏷️ Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Metaphor** | Understanding one thing in terms of another |
| **Metonymy** | Referring to something by a related concept |
| **Idiom** | Fixed phrase with figurative meaning |
| **Embodied Cognition** | Idea that understanding is grounded in physical experience |
| **Career of Metaphor** | Development from novel to conventional metaphor usage |

---

## 🧪 In-Class Activities

### 🎭 Metaphor Generation Game

- Pairs generate metaphors for abstract concepts like **time**, **emotion**, **power**.
- Class votes on which are **conventional**, **novel**, or **mixed**.

### 🧩 Idiom Matching Task

- Students match idioms with their literal equivalents and explain **transparency**.
- Discussion: Are idioms stored or interpreted on the fly?

### 🧠 Embodiment Demonstration

- Students read sentences like “She grasped the concept” or “He kicked the idea around.”
- Reflect on physical sensations or imagery involved in interpretation.

## ❓ Self-Check Questions

1. How does the Standard Pragmatic View explain figurative language processing?
2. What does the Career of Metaphor hypothesis predict about metaphor familiarity?
3. How does embodied cognition challenge traditional views of language processing?
4. What brain areas are involved in metaphor and idiom comprehension?

---

## 🧩 Practice Prompt

> Sentence: “She broke the ice with a joke.”  
> - What type of nonliteral language is this?
> - Is this a conventional or novel use?
> - What mental processes are involved in understanding it?
